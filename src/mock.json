We are rebooting the news. We do three things to change the news for both the audience and the journalist.\n\nWe connect the news audience directly to the journalists they support: no middleman of The New York Times, FOX News, or CNN. Just a direct connection between audience and journalist.\n\nThe CrowdNews audience         decides what news is valuable to them, without the filter of Big Media.\n\nOur audience gets exactly the news they want, on the topics they care about, at the price they want. \n\nCrowdNews journalists take charge of their own careers: they have the freedom to choose which stories to explore; they build their own reputations; and they get paid each and every time their work is consumed.\n\nThat’s CrowdNews.\n\nWe connect the audience directly to the journalist.\n\nOur audience decides what news is valuable to them.\n\nWe make sure the journalist gets paid for their work.\n\nPosted by J. Michael Wheeler on 06/05/2014 in Audience , CrowdNe.ws , Future of News , Journalists , Our Users , The News. Permalink. Comments (0)\n\nBack in the Industrial Age, the newspaper was a pretty good idea. You fed journalists' content in the front door, cranked up the printing presses, put the ink on the paper, loaded the delivery trucks out the back door, and distributed the printed newspapers to newsboys who yelled \"Extra! Extra!\"\n\nTelevision and radio pretty much use the same model. Substitute TV studio for printing plant.\n\nAnd what paid for the news? Your time paid for it. The time you spent to read, watch, and listen to Advertising. Big Media rented you out to their advertisers.\n\nThat model worked pretty well during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nPaying Journalists Online\n\nIn this online world, how can journalists get paid fairly for their work?\n\nToday, legacy news organizations slash budgets and slash staff as ad revenues dry up. Because of this, the quality and quantity of news has suffered. The audience no longer gets the news they want and need but are fed an overabundance of sports, traffic, and weather. They’ve gotten frustrated and have abandoned traditional news outlets. \n\nPartial solutions to this problem include online versions of main stream media, news aggregation, and blogging. But the paywalls that main stream media erect only supports the institution, not the individual journalists. News aggregators re post existing content, essentially gathering the news for free, but the journalist, the actual content creator, receives no direct benefit. Bloggers can be isolated creators with limited reputation, no marketplace, and little or no earnings. \n\nSo what’s the CrowdNews answer?\n\nWell firstly, we place the creator of the content at our very core. We build an innovative online marketplace that enables a direct connection between the journalist and the audience. This allows the audience to purchase their content directly from the content creator through our marketplace. By directly supporting the journalists they follow, the audience receives the quality news and content they desire, on the topics they care about, at the price they want. This direct funding empowers journalists with a new path for career and financial success. \n\nEverybody wins: the CrowdNews audience gets the news they want and our participating journalists take charge of their own careers. \n\nThe News: A User's Manual\n\nAs we build CrowdNe.ws, I'm fascinated by how our relationship, both as journalist and as audience, will change as the news ecosystem evolves. Journalists will tell their stories in new ways and the news audience will EAT their news (I don't like the term consume ) in new ways.\n\nThis is already true, isn't it? Newspapers, Walter Cronkite, and the Big Three News Networks are already part of an era past.\n\nHelping in this exploration is Alain De Botton’s The News: A User's Manual . I’ve just started reading it, but already I’d like to share some interesting thoughts from the book.  \n\nSocieties become modern, the philosopher Hegel suggested, when news replaces religion as our central source of guidance and our touchstone of authority. In the developed economies, the news now occupies a position of power at least equal to that formerly enjoyed by the faiths.\n\nHow many of us are News Junkies? How many of us turn to our news feed for answers rather than to our faith?\n\nBotton asks, in an age where \"the average citizen now has near instantaneous access to information about events in every nation on earth,\" whether the single most important technical skill for every journalist to possess is the capacity to collect information accurately.\n\nAnd I always answer that it’s one of the main reasons we’re building CrowdNe.ws: so that journalists get paid fairly for the work that they do. How else can quality journalism survive?\n\nAnd then I break down the numbers for them. Usually I start with a small example, such as covering local news. But I had a meeting recently with a well known public radio journalist who hosts a daily news program. I used that journalists’ numbers for our conversation. \n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\nLet’s say that our host moves the show to CrowdNe.ws. Currently the program has a weekly audience of over 1.5 million. \n\nIf just 20% of the audience moves to CrowdNe.ws too, that’s an audience of 300,000. Per week.\n\nAnd let’s say that audience values the show at  a reasonable $1 per week. \n\nThat’s $300,000 of revenue. Per week.\n\nAfter payment processing (Amazon or other) our journalist keeps about 70% of the revenue, and pays for production costs of the show.\n\nOur host could clear $200,000. Per week.\n\nSo how about the numbers for local news?\n\nToday I had conversation with a journalist who lives in a small town north of Boston with a population of 17,000. Those people feel underserved by the local paper. Could he make money on CrowdNews?\n\nLet’s say of those 17,000 about half are interested in local politics, schools, development, and other local issues: 8,500. \n\nAnd our local journalist writes a great, in depth story about the planned downtown development and 20% of the interested population value that story at $0.50.\n\nAgain, after payment processing (Amazon or other) our journalist keeps about 70% of the revenue.\n\nOur local journalist just earned almost $600. That’s a lot of money for a local story. Even half of that is a lot for a local story.\n\nBut here’s the real interesting thing about local on CrowdNe.ws. It’s really global. Because, while our journalist wrote a story about a development issue in a small town north of Boston. the city of Fresno, California, or Honolulu, Hawaii may be exploring a similar issue.\n\nChange: Rider, Elephant, and Path\n\nOne thing that we know for certain here at CrowdNe.ws, is that what we now call the news will continue to evolve and change for both the audience and the journalist. \n\nJournalists have new tools (video phones, mobil devices), new ways of reporting (data journalism), and new markets (CrowdNe.ws). The toolbox journalists use will continue to expand.\n\nThe way journalists will tell their stories will evolve too: multimedia, interactive, time based, location based. \n\nWill all journalists embrace the changes? Nope. Some will and some won’t. \n\n The news audience will have a multitude of choices. Does the model of big media still resonate with the audience or does the audience want more control over their news? Some will want change, and some won’t. \n\n It’s really very exciting to be right in the midst of this change.\n\nBut change can be difficult. And because CrowdNe.ws is at the forefront of this evolution of news, I’m very interested how we can remove the obstacles to those changes.\n\n \n\nIn Switch, Chip and Dan Heath have asked, “Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?”\n\nThe primary obstacle, say the Heaths, is a conflict that’s built into our brains. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems—the rational mind and the emotional mind—that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort—but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.\n\n For change to happen we need to address the rational mind (the Rider), the emotional mind (the  Elephant) and the Path upon which the Rider and Elephant travel.\n\nA good read and  good insights from Switch . \n\nA La Carte Journalism: Where People (and Reporters) Set the Agenda.

There remains a big debate about whether slack remains in the labor force , so economists will be closely watching this number. \n\nThe economy has recently been showing signs of strength, with auto sales for May coming at their fastest pace since May 2007. ISM's manufacturing index, after two revisions , showed manufacturing activity that beat expectations in April . \n\nAt Societe Generale, Brian Jones and his team expect the report to show the economy added 240,000 jobs in May with the unemployment rate ticking down to 6.2%. \n\nFrom SocGen: \n\n\"Our analysis suggests that market participants should be prepared for what might very well be the strongest overall canvass thus far in 2014. Improving business conditions, combined with normal seasonal weather patterns, likely boosted nonfarm payrolls by 240,000 in May, essentially matching the average job gain posted over the prior three- month span. A projected decline in our augmented insured unemployment gauge between household survey periods implies that the civilian jobless rate dipped to 6.2% – the lowest reading since September 2008. Other key labour market metrics, in particular average hourly earnings, will probably flash green as well in the upcoming report.\"\n\nJobless claims came in at 312,000 earlier this morning , but the four week average for the reading fell to its lowest level since June 2007. \n\nOn Tuesday of this week, ADP reported that private United States  companies added 179,000 jobs in May short of expectations for additions of 210,000, although Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson has argued the ADP report does a poor job of predicting the number. He sees nonfarm payrolls coming in at 230,000. \n\nChris Rupkey at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ sees nonfarm payrolls coming in at 210,000. Rupkey notes that  this morning's jobless claims number was good news for the economy.\n\n\"We don’t see the slack economic conditions that Fed officials see, and unemployment claims don’t either. Current conditions could not be any better. First time jobless claims rose slightly by 8K to 312K in the May 31 week.  These are levels we tend to see during robust economic expansions, where any job losses are modest frictional ones in a normal, growing $17 trillion economy. Unemployment claims are better than they were in April... This is evidence, anecdotal to be sure, that we could get a big 200K plus payroll jobs tomorrow.\" \n\nFinancial estimates firm Estimize said its crowdsourced consensus expectations for tomorrow's report  are currently at 243,000 . \n\nWe've noted that this  is the moment of truth for the United States  economy, and tomorrow we'll get a big piece of the answer.\n\nIt's Jobs Day In America: Here's What You Need To Know\n\n7 Daily Rituals Of Highly Effective Leaders\n\nMore \"Moving Forward\" »\n\nMore \"Monday Scouting Report\" »\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nHere Are The Running Accessories Actually Worth Buying\n\nE Commerce And The Future Of Retail 2014 [SLIDE DECK]\n\nBeacons: What They Are, How They're Used For Payments And Retail, And Why Apple's Ahead\n\n* Copyright © 2014 Business Insider Inc.

(Supplied)\n\nBased on 20 years of service delivery, this Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure Framework for the period 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 seeks to accelerate social, economic and infrastructure development. We hope to provide sustainable services to improve quality, accelerate the broadening of services and ensure our city is a preferred destination for growth and development. \n\nOur plans for the period ahead are anchored on transformation imperatives that will create work opportunities and build a more equal society.\n\nWe remain committed to building the local economy to create employment and sustainable livelihoods, improving the performance of and broadening access to all services, building social cohesion for safer communities, promoting active public participation, and ensuring more effective and accountable local government.\n\nWe focus on improving infrastructure that is poorly located, inadequate and under maintained, and to re industrialise our economy through revitalisation of the manufacturing sector.\n\nSocio economic outlook\n\nWhile our economy has shown resilience in the wake of recent economic difficulties, it is not immune to the consequences of global instability. As with the rest of the country, the City of Ekurhuleni’s economy is still characterised by slow economic growth. \n\nDespite skills, job creation and economic empowerment initiatives, the unemployment rate remains a major concern, particularly the 36.9% youth unemployment.\n\nOur training incentive schemes, empowerment in infrastructure and extended public works programme must target young people. \n\nWe also have a duty to broaden opportunities for those who do not have secure income, formal jobs, houses, electricity, water and access to healthcare. \n\nWe understand the important role small business plays in job creation. Our intention is to realise 75% procurement of local content. \n\nIn support of our developmental growth path, we will also consider protecting well located public spaces for small businesses to unlock economic opportunities. This will change the spatial landscape, support industrial development and optimise urban development through strategic partnership with the private sector, stimulating growth, job creation and densification of our city.\n\nFinancial overview\n\nOur conservative approach since 2011 strengthened our financial position, accumulating just under R1 billion in reserves to fund future infrastructure requirements. We intend building sufficient reserve to maintain this. \n\nOur recent Aa3.za credit rating indicates low exposure to credit risk for servicing long term debt and the best ability to pay our short term debt. \n\nOur revenue is R85 billion, comprising R28 billion in 2014/15 and representing an increase of 5.7% annually. This covers R4 billion from assessment rates, R12 billion from electricity sales, R1 billion from refuse collection, R4 billion from water and sanitation, R5 billion from government grants, and R2 billion from other revenue. \n\nTo continue providing sustainable services, we propose the following tariff increase: 0% increase on cemeteries and recreational halls, 7.5% on assessment rates, between 6.3% and 7.6% on electricity, 8.1% increase on water for residential and business, 8% on sanitation for residential and business, and between 2.4% and 7.1% on refuse removal for residents and 6% for business.\n\nSocial support package\n\nThe municipality will provide the following social package relief:\n\n• The first R150 000 on property value is exempted from assessment rates;\n\n• For pensioners, an additional rebate for property assessments ranges from 10% to 100%;\n\n• Churches and NGOs are exempted from assessment rates;\n\n• All households will still enjoy 6kilolitres of water and sanitation service for free;\n\nIngredients\n\nJust under R800 million has been allocated to ensure Ekurhuleni’s registered indigents continue receiving 100% rebates on assessment rates, free 9 kilolitres of water, free 9 kilolitres of sanitation, free refuse removal, 100KW free basic electricity, and free burial. R17 million has been set aside for the Grant in Aid programme. \n\nOur collection rate is still below our 93% target, despite high capital pressure for service delivery. The revised revenue protection and enhancement project is designed to improve collection. \n\nElements include aggressive credit control measures to recover outstanding debt; reduction in the unacceptable levels of water losses; installation of water meters; reinstatement of the interest waiver scheme on outstanding accounts and increased awareness of the need to pay for services.\n\nExpenditure framework\n\nOur expenditure is R85 billion, comprising R28 billion in 2014/15, representing an increase of 5.7% annually. This covers R10 billion for bulk water, electricity and sewage; R2 billion for repairs and maintenance; R5 billion for personnel costs; R1 billion for bad debt provision; R2 billion for depreciation; and R8 billion for general and grants expenditure.\n\nOur expenditure increase of 5.7% is in line with inflation and operating costs are carefully controlled. Strategic sourcing, long term contracts and a centralised procurement process will ensure financial resilience. \n\nCapital investment\n\nEkurhuleni will invest R12 billion over this period. Our long term infrastructure investment is projected to be R85 billion. Our capital investment of R12 billion will be spent as follows: \n\n• R4 billion is allocated to transport, roads and storm water.\n\n• R1.9 billion will be spent on electricity network infrastructure.\n\n• R1.3 billion is allocated for water and sanitation network infrastructure.\n\n• R1.2 billion is allocated for human settlement, including provision of houses, land acquisition, urban renewal, development of social housing, upgrading of council rental stock and mixed use housing development. (Another R4.3 billion will be added to Ekurhuleni’s capital investment programme once full accreditation is assigned.)\n\n• R891 million is for developmental and renewal of public facilities.\n\n• R661 million is set aside for the safety of Ekurhuleni residents, upgrading policing precincts, new fire stations and the acquisition of additional police vehicles.\n\n• R556 million for upgrading information and communication technology.\n\n• R512 million for environmental resources management and the upgrading of waste management facilities and infrastructure.\n\n• R423 million for health and social development, including the construction and upgrading of clinics.\n\n• R330 million for the construction and rehabilitation of sport, art and recreational facilities and libraries.\n\nEnsuring the budget is spent according to our targets remains challenging. Zero spending impacts the acceleration of service delivery and economic growth of the city. Non spending will see the removal of performance bonuses, and quarterly budgeting and cash flow management will be initiated to drive capital expenditure.\n\nCity planning and economic development\n\nR174 million (R63 million 2014/2015) is allocated to facilitate the city’s economic development, growth and job creation. This includes the refurbishment of Springs Fresh Produce Market; the development of township economy and a township enterprise hub; and the development of township industrial parks.\n\nThe investment will be used for skills development programmes, and the mainstreaming of small business and co operatives into economic opportunities, targeting young people, women and people with disabilities. R120 million is allocated for skills development and bursaries.\n\nCustomer relations management\n\nInterfacing with our communities is important, and requires professionalism and properly resourced customer relations facilities. For this we have allocated R60 million, of which R44 million relates to 2014/2015.\n\nEkurhuleni municipality remains strongly committed to the principles of accountability, transparency, anti corruption, proper financial management and effective internal control systems.\n\nThe journey of fast tracking socio economic development continues, at the centre of which is the creation of jobs for sustainable livelihoods, reduction of poverty levels, reducing inequality and building a capable, developmental, cohesive and prosperous city. \n\nThrough our continued partnership with community members, business sectors, religious and other stakeholders we will move our city forward.\n\nMoses Makwakwa is the MMC for Finance at the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality.\n\nEditorial: End this dirty war, the NPA is broken\n\nWhat makes it so treacherous for those seeking to cut through the NPA murk is that Mxolisi Nxasana cannot be considered a straightforward victim.\n\nWe need to talk about caving in to nyaope\n\nThe Boks of beyond\n\nWhen the worst happens Accelerating services in Ekurhuleni Engaging the international landscape Driving energy efficiency\n\nSubscriptions","status":"MINED","properties":{"keywords":{"main":["ekurhuleni","development","services","water","topics","infrastructure","npa","electricity","increase","growth","expenditure","management","creation","government","socio","sanitation","assessment","framework","economy","rates","financial","service","opportunities","medium","waste","facilities","energy","finance","job","debt"]},"basic_stats":{"ave_sent_per_par":1.3278688192367554,"total_sentences":81,"avg_token_frequency":1.7235954999923706,"avg_entity_frequency":1.2307692766189575,"quality_score":65,"total_tokens":1415,"text_length":4,"ave_tok_per_sent":17,"read_time_est":5,"avg_token_weight":0.6446245312690735,"total_paragraphs":61},"job_meta":{"doc_source_name":"Mail & Guardian Index Feed","doc_title":"Accelerating services in Ekurhuleni","doc_source_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_published_date":1402041540000,"doc_source_feed_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_description":"Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality is set to provide sustainable services to its residents and enhance growth and development."},"social_stats":{"total":0,"fb_share":0,"linkedin":0,"reddit":0,"fb_comments":0,"fb_likes":0,"date":1402042772486,"fb_click":0,"googleplus":0,"fb_total":0,"stumbleupon":0,"twitter":0,"pinterest":0},"meta":{"job_start_date":1402042764884,"doc_source_name":"The M&G Online","date":1402042764884,"job_type":"feed_url","doc_url":"http://mg.co.za/article/2014-06-06-accelerating-services-in-ekurhuleni/","extractor":"feed_url","doc_aggregated_date":1402042764873,"doc_description":"Accelerating services in Ekurhuleni","doc_twitter_username":"","job_target":"MINE","doc_author":"Advertorial","doc_source_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_type":"article","doc_fingerprint":"70d08e96cf5de37fad628981bb6362636eb6df8b9bc61160101b10ff38a6f648","job_processors_applied":35,"multilingual":true,"doc_keywords":"Topics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEkurhuleni Metro","boilerpipe_extractor":"low_canola","main_language":"en","doc_source_feed_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","url_fingerprint":"3c7548e4c395b046d3645488451279e38aa8cf7e960cb4eeeb16d56b7c0827d8","doc_title":"Accelerating services in Ekurhuleni","doc_published_date":1402041540000,"doc_image":"http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2014/06/06/ads9266_landscape.jpg/676x380/","customer_id":"2c7f9a","job_id":"5391798b835b63f20312bbe5","job_duration_ms":7604}},"entities":[{"citations":2,"uid":"6a125d6ec71e4b2a2837402dd367a0ea51aec72e","class":null,"desc":"Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality is a metropolitan municipality that forms the local government of the East Rand region of Gauteng, South Africa.

Her announcement followed an email to the same effect from the Tracy Unified School District assistant superintendent for business, Casey Goodall.\n\nKimball already had to find new venues this year - the softball team played at Tracy Sports Complex and the baseball team played at West High - because lack of water made the fields at the school unplayable. Hernandez said he expected a group of concerned parents to attend Tuesday's TUSD Board of Education meeting to demand a solution, but the matter is not on the school board's agenda for discussion or action. TUSD contracts with West Side Irrigation District for water pumped out of Old River. While West Side Irrigation District can usually pump water out of the river from April to November, this year the irrigation district faces unprecedented restrictions. The California State Water Resources Control Board, at its May 20 meeting in Sacramento, declared that the state's drought, now in its third year, would require all water agencies to restrict pumping by early June, except those who have permits dating back to before 1914. West Side Irrigation District, formed in 1915, is one of the agencies affected by the resolution. Even those with pre 1914 water rights may have to stop pumping by mid June. The district's general manager, Dave Kaiser, said this is the first time in nearly 100 years that the state has told West Side Irrigation District to stop drawing water from the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. Kaiser said that the district delivered water to Kimball High just last week, but on Monday, the pumps will shut down for a week. With the possibility looming that the shutdown will last longer than a week, Kaiser was scrambling to figure out how the district would spread out its limited supplies of water this summer to farmers and other customers. \"Kimball High will be put into consideration like everyone else who receives water from us,\" Kaiser said. \"We will treat them like equal members of the district and get water to them as we can.\" Tracy Unified spokesman Joel Danoy confirmed Wednesday that the TUSD business services department got a phone call this week from West Side Irrigation District, notifying the school district that the irrigation pumps from West Side Irrigation District to Kimball High would be shut off Monday. \"The school district has done everything they can to keep the fields green,\" Danoy said. \"It's just out of our control at this point. It's at the state level. \"Right now, we're trying to find different options.\"","status":"MINED","properties":{"keywords":{"main":["kimball high","west side irrigation district","water","climate change","school","fields","joe hernandez","tracy unified school district","casey goodall","district","year","june 2014","tusd","wednesday","state","sea","softball","climate change affecting coastlines","climate change 2013","april","education","tracy sports","tracy unified","diamond harbour","old river","kolkata","joel danoy","climate change ,","sports","mean surface temperature"]},"basic_stats":{"ave_sent_per_par":3.0999999046325684,"total_sentences":31,"avg_token_frequency":1.6480686664581299,"avg_entity_frequency":2.5757575035095215,"quality_score":75,"total_tokens":789,"text_length":4,"ave_tok_per_sent":25,"read_time_est":3,"avg_token_weight":0.6407278180122375,"total_paragraphs":10},"job_meta":{"doc_source_name":"RSOE EDIS - Climate Change News","doc_title":"Drought could affect Kimball fields into 2015","doc_source_url":"http://cc.rsoe.hu/index.php","doc_published_date":1402041960000,"doc_source_feed_url":"http://cc.rsoe.hu/rss/news.php","doc_description":"<img src='http://cc.rsoe.hu/thumb.php?hirid=1244' width='150' height='100' border='0' alt='#'/> This year's drought, which forced the Kimball High baseball and softball teams off their parched fields for the 2014 spring sports season, could extend into 2015.

(Supplied)\n\nRetrenchments are happening, the price of food and other essentials is going up and paying the bills is becoming more of a challenge.\n\n“The average South African household has a debt to disposable income ratio of approximately 75%, meaning many households are unfortunately on the wrong side of this average,” says Kerry Fynn, chief executive of AlphaWealth. \n\n“As a nation we aren’t alone in this global affliction, but with our relatively high interest and inflation rates, ours is perhaps harder to manage than most. As a borrower and not an investor, the magic of compounding growth is working against you. \n\n“This is exacerbated if the interest rates you are borrowing at are higher than normal bank rates — the reason why micro finance lending can be so dangerous. Simultaneously, our low growth and high inflation rates mean our gross income is not increasing the way we need it to and our net income is actually shrinking after the effects of inflation. The consequence is that with too much debt we are simply squeezed into an untenable situation.” \n\nFor some the worst has already happened — death or retrenchment of the primary breadwinner is catastrophic and not easy to manage or recover from. For others the bills are getting harder to pay and things are about to hit breaking point. \n\nCraig Gradidge, investment and retirement planning specialist at Gradidge Mahura Investments, says: “It is important that people take action sooner rather than later. People have a tendency to avoid uncomfortable and difficult situations. Financial distress often leads to shame as people are exposed to leading lifestyles they can’t afford. However, it is important that people seek advice and counseling while they still have options and can take corrective action. \n\n“If there are children in the picture, protect the house so those kids have stability and the security of a roof over their heads. Lose DStv, gym contracts, clothing accounts and other luxuries fast. The ability to prioritise and sacrifice is key in getting out of financial difficulty.\n\n“While you still have work or regular income, consider your monthly income,” comments DebtSafe counselor Wikus Olivier. “Consider your monthly expenses and then draw up a budget, which will enable you to build up a reserve fund to absorb the essential expenses during a time of crisis. Your dependence on credit facilities during an emergency becomes reduced and enables you to recover a lot quicker.”\n\nPaul Roelofse, certified financial planner and consumer advocate for the Financial Planning Institute of South Africa, says: “If you are spending more than you are earning then you should rather cut back than borrow money to maintain your standard of living. Debt is not the answer because the cost of the interest will increase your cost of living. This gets worse when interest rates rise as they apply to credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans, bonds and car repayments.”\n\nManaging your debts\n\nIf you cannot pay your debts, says Johan Maree, chief executive of FNB Credit Card, “contact your bank and notify them as soon as possible of financial difficulties. This way the bank, in most instances, will be able to assist with a special repayment plan. This is a much better alternative than avoiding the situation, which could result in you being listed with the credit bureaux and possibly restricting access to credit in the future. Some banks are able to offer their customers debt solutions that will further assist in providing some relief on their budget before a payment is missed.”\n\nThe same applies to other creditors, says financial consultant and instructor of the UCT Basics of Financial Management short course Gareth Cotten: “Contact your creditors and let them know that you will be behind that month. As a creditor, this is more preferable than having to chase a debtor for weeks or months only to be told that you cannot pay. Then, it’s time to take a long, hard look at your income and expenses. If you can’t pay your bills, your expenses are exceeding your income, plain and simple.”\n\nFinancial Junction director for financial management and taxation Lynn Marais says: “Your debts can be restructured by extending terms of repayment and lowering the monthly payments. Your monthly obligation can be lowered by 50%; this restructuring process is usually then made an order of the court. As long as you pay in terms of the court order you are protected from legal action by creditors. Once you have completed the process or feel you are no longer indebted, you may notify your debt counselor to pay your normal instalments.”\n\nRyan Belgrove, executive financial planner at Standard Bank, says: “Debt counselors tend to be expensive. This would be your last resort. Your bank has financial planners who would assist in helping you set up a repayment plan that will best suit you.\n\n“Should you find yourself in the inevitable position of being retrenched, losing your monthly income and not being able to afford debt counseling, you can always personally negotiate with your creditors and ask for reductions in outstanding amounts due,” Marais says. \n\n“Obviously not all creditors will agree to these reductions, depending on the particular severity of the debt, but most creditors will. This is beneficial to you because it will enable you to pay off your debt in arrears faster than what you originally would have. \n\n“You need to do a thorough budget showing all your accounts and debt as well as your monthly expenditure, present this to your creditors andcredit providers and request that they assist in suitable affordable repayment proposals. Negotiate with your major credit providers first, your vehicle finance company and home loan credit provider, requesting immediate lower instalments. Embarking on sorting out your debt can be a terrifying experience, but most creditors and credit providers are open to assisting and offering help and education.”\n\nFinding employment\n\nGodfrey Madanhire, life coach and professional motivational speaker, says: “It’s easier to get another job if you have a job, and your mindset needs to be on getting some work, even if you bounce around between a few jobs for a while. Get some form of money coming in. This makes a huge difference.” \n\nFynn says: “Not all debt is created equal and if you are over indebted, there’s a good chance your debt is to multiple lenders. Write down the total owing to each lender, the term of the debt and interest charged. Rank them according to the most expensive. Concentrate on settling the most expensive debt first and working your way down the list. If you have managed to improve your net disposable income and can demonstrate this to your bank, you may be able to increase your senior debt, which is by far the cheapest. \n\nThen, he says, “Give yourself a reasonable amount of time to reverse your position from being a net borrower/spender to a net saver/investor. Let the magic of compound growth work for instead of against you for a change. That’s how fortunes are made.”\n\nTips for managing debt\n\nRowan Burger, head of alternative products for Momentum Employee Benefits says it is important to prioritise your debts. \n\n“Pay off those with higher interest rates first. In terms of multiple credit card debts, stop using all but one credit card while you pay off these debts. Cut them up if needs be.\n\n“If you are having trouble paying off your water or electricity bill, contact the provider. Some of them will have a plan in place that allows you to settle your bill in instalments.\n\n“Take note of your spending: For one month, write down everything you spend. This is your key to getting out of debt. Avoiding more debt starts with knowing what you are spending your money on.

A series of stories in 2013 described his newly acquired assets and sought to shed light on how the markets for them worked.\n\nI had up to $5,000 of savings I was willing to risk. I ended up investing around $3,600. (For a breakdown of the investments, click here .) I separated the investments into two distinct categories.\n\nMore flavorful assets that I chose primarily (OK, exclusively) for their storytelling potential, like buying a painting online, making a bulk haul at Costco as a hedge against inflation and betting on coffee futures.\n\nSo here's the scorecard.\n\nFair warning 1: My idiosyncratic portfolio was assembled for a reporting adventure. It's not meant to be investment advice. Far from it. This in no way, shape or form resembles how I've invested for retirement. Do not copy my investments. It could be an epic mistake. You've been forewarned.\n\nFair warning 2: All strong returns were entirely the result of luck and/or fortuitous timing. As they say on Wall Street, past performance is no guarantee of future results. All disappointing results were well worth it in pursuit of a good story.\n\nYou must be signed in to leave a comment.

But some scholars argue something else has taken that conflict's place: a \"cool war,\" pitting the United States  against China.\n\n\"We're acting in a lot of ways as though we were at war,\" says Harvard scholar Noah Feldman, the author of Cool War: The Future of Global Competition.\n\n\"But at the same time, we're also trading with each other and cooperating with each other in a wide range of economic areas and it's that strange combination of competition and cooperation that's a cool war.\"\n\nUnlike the Cold War, the cool war is largely fought economically. It involves not bombs, but server space. And instead of secret agents wearing disguises, the cool war is being waged by faceless hackers thousands of miles away, who break into vast data systems.\n\nOn May 19, the United States  escalated by bringing its first ever charges against foreign government officials for cyberspying, indicting Chinese military agents for hacking into computer systems of American firms. United States  companies have become both the targets and the proxies in the cool war — according to Attorney General Eric Holder, the Chinese have been hacking Westinghouse, United States  Steel, Alcoa and more than 60 other companies for half a decade.\n\nUnited States  Files Criminal Charges Against Chinese Officials Over Cyberspying\n\n\"The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no other reason than to advantage state owned companies in China at the expense of businesses here in the United States,\" Holder said at his press conference announcing the charges.\n\nThe Chinese deny the charges. And this spring, leaked NSA documents showed the United States  previously infiltrated Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qing Gang reminded the public of that on state run CCTV .\n\ni i\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\"It is known to the world what the United States  has done in cyberspying and surveillance. On cybersecurity issues, we would like the whole world to judge who should be put on the defendant's stand legally and morally,\" Qing said.\n\nSo the United States  called out China for spying on American companies. The Chinese say the United States  has been doing spying all along, on Chinese companies. China is now retaliating economically. It's requiring American tech firms like Cisco to go through cybersecurity vetting , and failure to pass vetting could mean a ban.\n\nChina is also taking Windows 8 operating systems off all government computers, saying Microsoft is stealing personal data of Chinese citizens. No duck and cover, but lots of business related back and forth.\n\n\"It affects our lives as Americans in a wide range of ways that aren't immediately obvious to us,\" Feldman says. Unseen as it may be, this cool war represents an ongoing power struggle with geopolitical consequences — and plenty of present day problems for American companies whose trade secrets are at stake.\n\n\"It's a reminder to tech companies, many of them already know this, if they're big enough, that they need to keep their heads up, and be aware that their data is not secure and it's not just Big Brother, Uncle Sam that's listening, it's also Beijing that's listening in,\" Feldman says.\n\nComment\n\nYou must be signed in to leave a comment.

These are the rare European mouflon, nearest ancestors of the domestic species, here arranged in a very interesting defensive display of rams; mouflon image ; Credit: © Shutterstock\n\nNot many of us can separate the sheep from the goats. Those who appear bright of course are thought to be goats, while sheep are frequently considered as people who willingly follow and are just not quite the full shilling! The time when sheep really separated from the goat genus, 4 million years ago, has now been established with the publication of the full sheep genome. 99% of the genome is found on the 26 autosomes and the X chromosome.\n\nThe International Sheep Genome Consortium, led by Yu Jiang of Yangling University and Kunming Institute of Zoology, and personalities from Shenzhen, Edinburgh University and the Roslin Institute nearby (don't forget Dolly!), Utah State University the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Otago University, Washington State University, King Abdulassiz University, KSA, , Copenhagen University, thee European Molecular Biology Lab., and many other US, Chinese, Australian and New Zealand institutions publish the genome in the journal Science as - \"The sheep genome\" .\n\nOf the 7 current species of sheep, only Ovis aries is considered the domestic sheep, descended from the European mouflon,Ovis musimon. The meat, milk wool and even hair/pelts (from hair sheep) from millions of individual animals have provided for the human species longer than almost any other species. The rumen of sheep, in the same way as that of the bovines or cattle, manipulates the ligno cellulose from grass digestion in highly developed ways, seemingly using keratin cross linking genes in the evolution of the organ.\n\nThe other smaller parts of the sheep \"stomach\" are the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum. From the genome, fat metabolism was also found to interact in wool synthesis, creating several new lines of research for those involved in the huge agribusiness that makes up sheep farming at the moment.\n\nWatch this space for more on the ovine, bovine and the capricornian (if that astronomical word can be used here!) evolutions and what we can make of this new knowledge of their intimate genetic secrets.\n\nFinding sheep 'geneius' in their genome\n\nWhat can we make of the revelations on how species are really related to each other - or not? Big business will certainly cash in on the wool or any wool substitute alternative, just as spider silk is building into a stiff competitor. We all benefit from the science that informs, with Open wherever possible, and creates almost automatic advances in our culture. The sheep has been with us from the beginning of settlements and still looks likely to give us information on how we have eaten and kept warm and how domestic animals have changed, not always for our convenience.\n\nWorld Environment Day: June 5th, 2014 (and the 4th for tweets)\n\nWe so rarely consider the earth in all its guises. The environment is our atmosphere, our soil and our water, and all the other bits that make us the fabulous blue planet from the outside. Today is the day to consider just one or many things to do - for the whole environment.\n\nGannets prove to be discard specialists\n\nWhen fisheries policies change, we have rarely managed to avoid mistakes in estimating the effects. Here we have happy gannets but when fishing discards are prevented, the rocky islands around Ireland and the rest of Europe will be less populous than before.\n\nWriting Your Free Ticket for Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2014\n\nAre you interested in ''how cities can contribute to the advancement of sustainable development and address issues including water, energy and waste?''

The dramatic singular act on June 5, 1989 came to represent the spirit of struggle between ordinary citizens and a repressive government. &#160; The identity of the man and his eventual fate remain unknown to this day. We do know who took the photograph - American Jeff Widener, who was working for the Associated Press. He shares his story of taking that photo, and tells VOA’s Jim Stevenson about the many obstacles that could have prevented the world from ever seeing it. &#160; WIDENER: I was the Southeast Asia picture editor for Associated Press, my job was basically to cover the southern region, however this story was building into something really big, so they wanted me to come up there and help out on the story. The problem was that the Beijing government didn’t want to give me a journalist’s visa and they denied it so I had to figure out another way to get into China. &#160; So I booked a tour, I was coming in as a tourist. When I got in there, to the airport, I had to figure out a way to smuggle all of my camera gear in, and this is a big concern, I thought I might get arrested. &#160; So fortunately, something was going on with an old lady and a chicken in the corner of the terminal, and all of the customs guys ran off to the side and left me alone and I just pushed the carts over to the waiting taxis and got to the AP office. &#160; &#160; From that point on, my job was to go to Tiananmen Square every morning and photograph the activities. And it was, you know, a very jovial experience, almost like a carnival atmosphere, everybody was celebrating this new freedom that they had. It was an amazing scene. &#160; Eventually I was given the order to do the first night shift, and on the night of June 4th, I went out and things started really getting pretty heavy. There was a burning armored car. I lifted the camera to my eye at the second a giant, a large brick hit me in the face, the camera absorbed the blow and fortunately saved my life and then I had to get back to the AP office and file. &#160; I didn’t go back out I was just too scared, I was sick, I had a massive concussion, and with a flash it would have been suicidal. And the following day I got a message again from AP, “we don’t want anyone to take any unnecessary risks, but if someone could please grab the occupied Tiananmen Square, we’d appreciate it.” &#160; So I drew the small straw again and it was my job to go to the Beijing Hotel which had the closest vantage point. And I got there and I had to get past secret police, who were using electric cattle prods on the journalists. Fortunately, one young college kid from America named Kirk Martsen, he managed to smuggle me up into his room, and that’s where I made the Tank Man photograph. &#160; STEVENSON: This must be an absolutely astounding scene that was playing out before your eyes as you’re watching this lone gentleman walk out into the street in front of a line of tanks. &#160; WIDENER: Well, it was and it wasn’t, because you have to remember I had a massive concussion. I was really spaced out and nothing was really making a lot of sense to me, so seeing a guy walk out in the middle of a boulevard with shopping bags and confronting tanks just seemed par for the course. And actually, when I saw the tanks coming down to the street, I lined up my 400 mm lens and I thought, “well, you know, this is a nice shot,” and a guy walks out and the first things I said was, “this guy is going to screw up my composition.” And then Kirk is screaming “they’re going to kill him! They’re going to kill him!” &#160; And so, you know, I looked at this guy just waiting for the instant he’s going to be, you know, shot, but nothing happened. You know, he’s just still there, standing there. So, I realized the picture was too far away, and I looked back at the bed where I had a lens doubler, this would increase my focal length to 800 mm, so the situation was, do I gamble and maybe miss the shot completely or do I go and try to increase the magnification to get a better picture? &#160; Well I did that, and I took three frames. And I realized there was something wrong with my camera setting and the shutter speed was too slow, and by that time “Tank Man” was taken away. It was an error I made on the sensitivity of the film, but fortunately one picture came out. &#160; STEVENSON: How were you able to get your film out of there with so much security in the hotel? &#160; WIDENER: Well, thank God for Kirk Martsen, because he was instrumental in not only getting me to the roof to photograph the occupied Tiananmen Square, which is my main goal, but he also helped me get this film past the secret police. &#160; You know, he just looked, you know, sort of like a college student, he had short pants on, sandals, a dirty “Rambo” t shirt. You know, he just looked like a, you know, young kid. And so he smuggled all of my film into his shorts, and I remember standing on the balcony, looking straight below me, and you could see the security guys – they were all sitting there have a smoke break, and Kirk just strolls right by them. You know, one of the most iconic images, and one of the most embarrassing images for China, and he just walks by these guys with their cigarettes, gets on a bicycle, slowly unchains it, and I’m just looking down saying “go, go, go, go,” and then he gets on the bike and starts pedaling away, although a little bit awkwardly, because all of the film is in his, you know, shorts, and it’s a painful experience I guess riding with that much film in your shorts, but he goes looking for the AP office and he can’t find it, [and he] is smart enough to think about going to the American Embassy, tell them it’s very important film and it needs to go to AP. &#160; Fortunately, the American Embassy did that, they transferred the film over to the office and it was transmitted to the rest of the world. &#160;He probably risked his life doing that. &#160; STEVENSON: With the immediacy of television where you could see these images just down the street from your location, and radio – you were dealing with film in that era. I mean, it wasn’t like a digital camera of today, and then this [film] had to be developed and then transmitted. &#160; WIDENER: Well, you’re right about that, and in fact, that impact form the rock that hit me, it hit the camera when it was to my face. It ripped the entire top of the camera off, the flash, the lens; it shattered the mirror and bent the titanium shutter curtain – that’s how strong the impact was, and when we got the film back to the office, Mark Avery who was the photo editor then for AP, he had to go in the dark room, and literally take pliers to pry the film out to develop it.&#160; &#160; The other thing that’s interesting about that is that because we were so busy, the chemicals were not refreshed properly. The “Tank Man” negative started disintegrating almost immediately, and fortunately AP managed to preserve it long enough digitally before it completely disintegrated. And right now, basically the negative is just gone completely. ___________________________________________________________________ One other interesting caveat to the story, Jeff Widener had run out of film and was fortunate enough to secure a roll from a tourist. That was the film used for the “Tank Man” photo.","status":"MINED","properties":{"keywords":{"main":["ap","jeff widener","tank man","voice","film","tiananmen square","q&a","rsb","camera","voa","man","street","tanks","office","freedom","picture","photograph","american embassy","beijing hotel","associated press","southeast asia","guy","vantage point","jim stevenson","voanews","photographer","beijing","mark avery","kirk martsen","story"]},"basic_stats":{"ave_sent_per_par":9,"total_sentences":36,"avg_token_frequency":1.7731958627700806,"avg_entity_frequency":2.153846263885498,"quality_score":85,"total_tokens":1651,"text_length":4,"ave_tok_per_sent":45,"read_time_est":6,"avg_token_weight":0.5795585513114929,"total_paragraphs":4},"job_meta":{"doc_source_feed_url":"http://www.voanews.com/api/epiqq","doc_source_name":"Voice of America","doc_title":"Q&A with Jeff Widener: 'Tank Man' Photographer","doc_source_url":"http://www.voanews.com","doc_published_date":1402032620000,"doc_description_quality":"FULL","doc_description":"Perhaps the most iconic image from 25 years ago at Tiananmen Square was that of a Chinese man standing in the middle of the street halting the progression of several army tanks.

When I got in there, to the airport, I had to figure out a way to smuggle all of my camera gear in, and this is a big concern, I thought I might get arrested. &#160; So fortunately, something was going on with an old lady and a chicken in the corner of the terminal, and all of the customs guys ran off to the side and left me alone and I just pushed the carts over to the waiting taxis and got to the AP office. &#160; &#160; From that point on, my job was to go to Tiananmen Square every morning and photograph the activities. And it was, you know, a very jovial experience, almost like a carnival atmosphere, everybody was celebrating this new freedom that they had. It was an amazing scene. &#160; Eventually I was given the order to do the first night shift, and on the night of June 4th, I went out and things started really getting pretty heavy. There was a burning armored car. I lifted the camera to my eye at the second a giant, a large brick hit me in the face, the camera absorbed the blow and fortunately saved my life and then I had to get back to the AP office and file. &#160; I didn’t go back out I was just too scared, I was sick, I had a massive concussion, and with a flash it would have been suicidal. And the following day I got a message again from AP, “we don’t want anyone to take any unnecessary risks, but if someone could please grab the occupied Tiananmen Square, we’d appreciate it.” &#160; So I drew the small straw again and it was my job to go to the Beijing Hotel which had the closest vantage point. And I got there and I had to get past secret police, who were using electric cattle prods on the journalists. Fortunately, one young college kid from America named Kirk Martsen, he managed to smuggle me up into his room, and that’s where I made the Tank Man photograph. &#160; STEVENSON: This must be an absolutely astounding scene that was playing out before your eyes as you’re watching this lone gentleman walk out into the street in front of a line of tanks. &#160; WIDENER: Well, it was and it wasn’t, because you have to remember I had a massive concussion. I was really spaced out and nothing was really making a lot of sense to me, so seeing a guy walk out in the middle of a boulevard with shopping bags and confronting tanks just seemed par for the course. And actually, when I saw the tanks coming down to the street, I lined up my 400 mm lens and I thought, “well, you know, this is a nice shot,” and a guy walks out and the first things I said was, “this guy is going to screw up my composition.” And then Kirk is screaming “they’re going to kill him! They’re going to kill him!” &#160; And so, you know, I looked at this guy just waiting for the instant he’s going to be, you know, shot, but nothing happened. You know, he’s just still there, standing there. So, I realized the picture was too far away, and I looked back at the bed where I had a lens doubler, this would increase my focal length to 800 mm, so the situation was, do I gamble and maybe miss the shot completely or do I go and try to increase the magnification to get a better picture? &#160; Well I did that, and I took three frames. And I realized there was something wrong with my camera setting and the shutter speed was too slow, and by that time “Tank Man” was taken away. It was an error I made on the sensitivity of the film, but fortunately one picture came out. &#160; STEVENSON: How were you able to get your film out of there with so much security in the hotel? &#160; WIDENER: Well, thank God for Kirk Martsen, because he was instrumental in not only getting me to the roof to photograph the occupied Tiananmen Square, which is my main goal, but he also helped me get this film past the secret police. &#160; You know, he just looked, you know, sort of like a college student, he had short pants on, sandals, a dirty “Rambo” t-shirt. You know, he just looked like a, you know, young kid. And so he smuggled all of my film into his shorts, and I remember standing on the balcony, looking straight below me, and you could see the security guys – they were all sitting there have a smoke break, and Kirk just strolls right by them. You know, one of the most iconic images, and one of the most embarrassing images for China, and he just walks by these guys with their cigarettes, gets on a bicycle, slowly unchains it, and I’m just looking down saying “go, go, go, go,” and then he gets on the bike and starts pedaling away, although a little bit awkwardly, because all of the film is in his, you know, shorts, and it’s a painful experience I guess riding with that much film in your shorts, but he goes looking for the AP office and he can’t find it, [and he] is smart enough to think about going to the American Embassy, tell them it’s very important film and it needs to go to AP. &#160; Fortunately, the American Embassy did that, they transferred the film over to the office and it was transmitted to the rest of the world. &#160;He probably risked his life doing that. &#160; STEVENSON: With the immediacy of television where you could see these images just down the street from your location, and radio – you were dealing with film in that era. I mean, it wasn’t like a digital camera of today, and then this [film] had to be developed and then transmitted. &#160; WIDENER: Well, you’re right about that, and in fact, that impact form the rock that hit me, it hit the camera when it was to my face. It ripped the entire top of the camera off, the flash, the lens; it shattered the mirror and bent the titanium shutter curtain – that’s how strong the impact was, and when we got the film back to the office, Mark Avery who was the photo editor then for AP, he had to go in the dark room, and literally take pliers to pry the film out to develop it.&#160; &#160; The other thing that’s interesting about that is that because we were so busy, the chemicals were not refreshed properly. The “Tank Man” negative started disintegrating almost immediately, and fortunately AP managed to preserve it long enough digitally before it completely disintegrated. And right now, basically the negative is just gone completely. ___________________________________________________________________ One other interesting caveat to the story, Jeff Widener had run out of film and was fortunate enough to secure a roll from a tourist. That was the film used for the “Tank Man” photo."},"social_stats":{"total":0,"fb_share":0,"linkedin":0,"reddit":0,"fb_comments":0,"fb_likes":0,"date":1402033649884,"fb_click":0,"googleplus":0,"fb_total":0,"stumbleupon":0,"twitter":0,"pinterest":0},"meta":{"job_start_date":1402033643194,"doc_source_name":"VOA","date":1402033643195,"doc_description_quality":"FULL","job_type":"feed_url","doc_url":"http://www.voanews.com/content/qa-with-jeff-widener-tank-man-photographer/1930878.html","extractor":"feed_url","doc_aggregated_date":1402033643168,"doc_description":"Perhaps the most iconic image from 25 years ago at Tiananmen Square was that of a Chinese man standing in the middle of the street halting the progression of several army tanks.

All sides agreed Russia should change its behavior, and they joined in threatening to slap new sanctions that would target entire sectors of the Russian economy. “We will have a chance to see what Mr. Putin does over the next two, three, four weeks, and if he remains on the current course, then we&#39;ve already indicated the kinds of actions that we&#39;re prepared to take,” Obama said at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron at the end of a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium. &#160; “Russia needs to seize that opportunity,” Obama said. “Russia needs to recognize that President elect [Petro] Poroshenko is the legitimately elected leader of Ukraine and engage the government in Kyiv.” &quot;Lockstep&quot; strategy Obama emerged from two days of meetings with the G7, saying it was a chance for the gathered leaders to make sure they are in “lockstep” on a strategy going forward in uncertain times in Ukraine. He and Cameron both praised the united front that the United States  and Europe has maintained in dealing with Russia and the crisis in Ukraine. &quot;What has been striking has been the degree of solidary between the United States and Europe in this crisis,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I&#39;ve been heartened by the steadfastness of Europe so far.&quot; &#160; Obama said he understands the real economic consequences on countries that have extensive trade ties with Russia, but indicated those have to be weighed against the values and principles that Russia has violated. “The choice is clear: Europeans have to stand up for those ideals and principles even if it creates some economic inconvenience,&quot; he said. The president said the United States  is looking at sanctions that would maximize the consequences on Russia but minimize the adverse effects on the economies of G7 nations. Dialogue encouraged Obama urged Putin to “enter into a dialogue” with&#160; Poroshenko, who is being inaugurated Saturday after winning the May 25 election. Cameron, who will meet with Putin later Thursday, said he plans to tell the Russian president that Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine are unacceptable and at odds with G7 leaders&#39; democratic values. The prime minister said he plans to discuss with Putin the demands outlined by the G7 members as a whole -- that Russia respect the results of Ukraine&#39;s presidential election, stop the flow of fighters and weapons to the eastern part of the country, and completely withdraw troops from its border with Ukraine If Putin does not meet the demands, Russia, whose economy has already begun to suffer from present sanctions, will possibly face harsher, sectoral sanctions, Cameron said. Mistral sale In other questions, Obama also said he had &quot;expressed some concerns&quot; to France about its sale of warships to Russia during this period. &#160; “I think it would have been preferable to press the pause button,&quot; Obama said in response to a question about the decision to go ahead with the sale of French Mistral warships despite events in Ukraine. France has come under pressure from some European allies to&#160; pull the plug on the 1.2 billion euro deal on the grounds Russia could use the Mistral class helicopter carriers to threaten its Black Sea neighbors. France agreed to the sale under a 2011 contract, with the first vessel due in October and the second in 2015. &#160; The Mistral, the second largest ship in the French navy, is a high seas military base that can transport up to 16 helicopters, four landing craft, 60 armed vehicles and some 700 troops. Other G7 action &#160; In other G7 action, the world&#39;s leading industrialized nations vowed on Thursday to seal a series of free trade deals that would radically change the shape of global commerce despite rising popular opposition. &#160; Leaders of the G7 committed themselves to eight far reaching accords that would encompass more than 80 percent of the world&#39;s economy but that effectively sideline China and Russia and have met with protests, particularly in Europe. &#160; In the most ambitious round of liberalization since the demise of the Doha round of global trade talks, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States want to create a market of almost a billion people and set world trade rules that the rest may have to follow. &#160; An EU United States  deal alone could generate $100 billion in additional economic output a year on both sides of the Atlantic. The G7 also gave their backing on Thursday to a new global deal on climate change in 2015. Earlier this week, the United States announced a plan to cut emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030, which will run into domestic opposition, prompting the European Union into a defense of its own record. &#160; China, the world&#39;s biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, also gave a hint that it would set some kind of cap on its emissions. &#160; A draft of the G7 communique seen by Reuters said the G7 nations remained committed to low carbon economies and limiting temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels, the limit scientists say can prevent the most devastating effects of climate change. And the G7 offered the EU support with its efforts to make its energy supplies more secure, promising to “complement the efforts of the European Commission to develop emergency energy plans for winter 2014 2015”. &#160; In Europe, the quest for energy security in the face of threats from Russia that it could disrupt supplies of gas pumped through Ukraine, has knocked the climate debate down the agenda. &#160; But addressing the G7 in Brussels, Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the two issues went “hand in hand.” &#160; EU nations said domestic, renewable sources, such as solar and wind, can reduce the need for fossil fuel imports from nations such as Russia, while Poland, which relies on polluting coal, said coal is a reliable, domestic fuel source. &#160; D Day ceremony Obama&#39;s aim at this G7 summit was to further isolate Russia and galvanize support among western European nations for tougher sanctions in case it is necessary to apply them. The summit was originally scheduled as a G 8 to be held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, with Putin as host. After Russia annexed Crimea, the economic powers revoked the Russian leader&#39;s invitation and moved the meeting to Brussels. &#160; &quot;Originally of course our summit was supposed to be in Sochi, but after Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine, our nations united quickly around a common strategy. We suspended Russia from the G8, and we canceled the Sochi meeting, making this the first G7 held without Russia in some 20 years,&quot; Obama said on Thursday. During the visit, though, it became clear that not all G 7 leaders were as eager as Obama to isolate Putin. The Russian president and Obama are both attending D Day commemorations in France Friday, but there are no plans for them to meet. Other G 7 leaders, however, are meeting privately with Putin, including French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Later Thursday, Obama headed to Paris and was to attend a dinner with Hollande, who had planned a second dinner with Putin later the same night. The meetings will come at a ceremony in Normandy, France to mark the 70th anniversary of the allied D Day invasion against Nazi forces in World War II. &#160; Kerry, Lavrov meet The top United States  and Russian diplomats met in Paris on Thursday, and agreed that Ukraine should be a bridge between Russia and the West and not be a “pawn” in a power struggle. &quot;President elect Poroshenko has made it clear that he wants to reach out to all of the people of Ukraine, and he intends to make a major effort to bring the country together,&quot; United States  Secretary of State John Kerry said before meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. &quot;This is an opportunity we hope for Russia, the United States, and others ... to make a Ukraine that is strong economically, whose sovereignty is respected, whose independence is respected, but which clearly is not the pawn in a tug of war between other nations ... [and] able to act as a bridge between east and west with trade, with engagement between all parties,&quot; Kerry said. &#160; “We would like to see Ukraine peaceful, stable. A place for all those who live in Ukraine ... to be feeling equal, respected, and listened to, living in peace being a bridge, not being a pawn,”&#160; Lavrov said.

All sides agreed Russia should change its behavior, and they joined in threatening to slap new sanctions that would target entire sectors of the Russian economy. “We will have a chance to see what Mr. Putin does over the next two, three, four weeks, and if he remains on the current course, then we&#39;ve already indicated the kinds of actions that we&#39;re prepared to take,” Obama said at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron at the end of a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium. &#160; “Russia needs to seize that opportunity,” Obama said. “Russia needs to recognize that President elect [Petro] Poroshenko is the legitimately elected leader of Ukraine and engage the government in Kyiv.” &quot;Lockstep&quot; strategy Obama emerged from two days of meetings with the G7, saying it was a chance for the gathered leaders to make sure they are in “lockstep” on a strategy going forward in uncertain times in Ukraine. He and Cameron both praised the united front that the United States  and Europe has maintained in dealing with Russia and the crisis in Ukraine. &quot;What has been striking has been the degree of solidary between the United States and Europe in this crisis,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I&#39;ve been heartened by the steadfastness of Europe so far.&quot; &#160; Obama said he understands the real economic consequences on countries that have extensive trade ties with Russia, but indicated those have to be weighed against the values and principles that Russia has violated. “The choice is clear: Europeans have to stand up for those ideals and principles even if it creates some economic inconvenience,&quot; he said. The president said the United States  is looking at sanctions that would maximize the consequences on Russia but minimize the adverse effects on the economies of G7 nations. Dialogue encouraged Obama urged Putin to “enter into a dialogue” with&#160; Poroshenko, who is being inaugurated Saturday after winning the May 25 election. Cameron, who will meet with Putin later Thursday, said he plans to tell the Russian president that Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine are unacceptable and at odds with G7 leaders&#39; democratic values. The prime minister said he plans to discuss with Putin the demands outlined by the G7 members as a whole -- that Russia respect the results of Ukraine&#39;s presidential election, stop the flow of fighters and weapons to the eastern part of the country, and completely withdraw troops from its border with Ukraine If Putin does not meet the demands, Russia, whose economy has already begun to suffer from present sanctions, will possibly face harsher, sectoral sanctions, Cameron said. Mistral sale In other questions, Obama also said he had &quot;expressed some concerns&quot; to France about its sale of warships to Russia during this period. &#160; “I think it would have been preferable to press the pause button,&quot; Obama said in response to a question about the decision to go ahead with the sale of French Mistral warships despite events in Ukraine. France has come under pressure from some European allies to&#160; pull the plug on the 1.2 billion euro deal on the grounds Russia could use the Mistral class helicopter carriers to threaten its Black Sea neighbors. France agreed to the sale under a 2011 contract, with the first vessel due in October and the second in 2015. &#160; The Mistral, the second largest ship in the French navy, is a high seas military base that can transport up to 16 helicopters, four landing craft, 60 armed vehicles and some 700 troops. Other G7 action &#160; In other G7 action, the world&#39;s leading industrialized nations vowed on Thursday to seal a series of free trade deals that would radically change the shape of global commerce despite rising popular opposition. &#160; Leaders of the G7 committed themselves to eight far reaching accords that would encompass more than 80 percent of the world&#39;s economy but that effectively sideline China and Russia and have met with protests, particularly in Europe. &#160; In the most ambitious round of liberalization since the demise of the Doha round of global trade talks, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States want to create a market of almost a billion people and set world trade rules that the rest may have to follow. &#160; An EU United States  deal alone could generate $100 billion in additional economic output a year on both sides of the Atlantic. The G7 also gave their backing on Thursday to a new global deal on climate change in 2015. Earlier this week, the United States announced a plan to cut emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030, which will run into domestic opposition, prompting the European Union into a defense of its own record. &#160; China, the world&#39;s biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, also gave a hint that it would set some kind of cap on its emissions. &#160; A draft of the G7 communique seen by Reuters said the G7 nations remained committed to low carbon economies and limiting temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels, the limit scientists say can prevent the most devastating effects of climate change. And the G7 offered the EU support with its efforts to make its energy supplies more secure, promising to “complement the efforts of the European Commission to develop emergency energy plans for winter 2014 2015”. &#160; In Europe, the quest for energy security in the face of threats from Russia that it could disrupt supplies of gas pumped through Ukraine, has knocked the climate debate down the agenda. &#160; But addressing the G7 in Brussels, Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the two issues went “hand in hand.” &#160; EU nations said domestic, renewable sources, such as solar and wind, can reduce the need for fossil fuel imports from nations such as Russia, while Poland, which relies on polluting coal, said coal is a reliable, domestic fuel source. &#160; D Day ceremony Obama&#39;s aim at this G7 summit was to further isolate Russia and galvanize support among western European nations for tougher sanctions in case it is necessary to apply them. The summit was originally scheduled as a G 8 to be held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, with Putin as host. After Russia annexed Crimea, the economic powers revoked the Russian leader&#39;s invitation and moved the meeting to Brussels. &#160; &quot;Originally of course our summit was supposed to be in Sochi, but after Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine, our nations united quickly around a common strategy. We suspended Russia from the G8, and we canceled the Sochi meeting, making this the first G7 held without Russia in some 20 years,&quot; Obama said on Thursday. During the visit, though, it became clear that not all G 7 leaders were as eager as Obama to isolate Putin. The Russian president and Obama are both attending D Day commemorations in France Friday, but there are no plans for them to meet. Other G 7 leaders, however, are meeting privately with Putin, including French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Later Thursday, Obama headed to Paris and was to attend a dinner with Hollande, who had planned a second dinner with Putin later the same night. The meetings will come at a ceremony in Normandy, France to mark the 70th anniversary of the allied D Day invasion against Nazi forces in World War II. &#160; Kerry, Lavrov meet The top United States  and Russian diplomats met in Paris on Thursday, and agreed that Ukraine should be a bridge between Russia and the West and not be a “pawn” in a power struggle. &quot;President elect Poroshenko has made it clear that he wants to reach out to all of the people of Ukraine, and he intends to make a major effort to bring the country together,&quot; United States  Secretary of State John Kerry said before meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. &quot;This is an opportunity we hope for Russia, the United States, and others ... to make a Ukraine that is strong economically, whose sovereignty is respected, whose independence is respected, but which clearly is not the pawn in a tug of war between other nations ... [and] able to act as a bridge between east and west with trade, with engagement between all parties,&quot; Kerry said. &#160; “We would like to see Ukraine peaceful, stable. A place for all those who live in Ukraine ... to be feeling equal, respected, and listened to, living in peace being a bridge, not being a pawn,”&#160; Lavrov said.

All sides agreed Russia should change its behavior, and they joined in threatening to slap new sanctions that would target entire sectors of the Russian economy. “We will have a chance to see what Mr. Putin does over the next two, three, four weeks, and if he remains on the current course, then we&#39;ve already indicated the kinds of actions that we&#39;re prepared to take,” Obama said at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron at the end of a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium. &#160; “Russia needs to seize that opportunity,” Obama said. “Russia needs to recognize that President-elect [Petro] Poroshenko is the legitimately elected leader of Ukraine and engage the government in Kyiv.” &quot;Lockstep&quot; strategy Obama emerged from two days of meetings with the G7, saying it was a chance for the gathered leaders to make sure they are in “lockstep” on a strategy going forward in uncertain times in Ukraine. He and Cameron both praised the united front that the U.S. and Europe has maintained in dealing with Russia and the crisis in Ukraine. &quot;What has been striking has been the degree of solidary between the United States and Europe in this crisis,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I&#39;ve been heartened by the steadfastness of Europe so far.&quot; &#160; Obama said he understands the real economic consequences on countries that have extensive trade ties with Russia, but indicated those have to be weighed against the values and principles that Russia has violated. “The choice is clear: Europeans have to stand up for those ideals and principles even if it creates some economic inconvenience,&quot; he said. The president said the U.S. is looking at sanctions that would maximize the consequences on Russia but minimize the adverse effects on the economies of G7 nations. Dialogue encouraged Obama urged Putin to “enter into a dialogue” with&#160; Poroshenko, who is being inaugurated Saturday after winning the May 25 election. Cameron, who will meet with Putin later Thursday, said he plans to tell the Russian president that Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine are unacceptable and at odds with G7 leaders&#39; democratic values. The prime minister said he plans to discuss with Putin the demands outlined by the G7 members as a whole -- that Russia respect the results of Ukraine&#39;s presidential election, stop the flow of fighters and weapons to the eastern part of the country, and completely withdraw troops from its border with Ukraine If Putin does not meet the demands, Russia, whose economy has already begun to suffer from present sanctions, will possibly face harsher, sectoral sanctions, Cameron said. Mistral sale In other questions, Obama also said he had &quot;expressed some concerns&quot; to France about its sale of warships to Russia during this period. &#160; “I think it would have been preferable to press the pause button,&quot; Obama said in response to a question about the decision to go ahead with the sale of French Mistral warships despite events in Ukraine. France has come under pressure from some European allies to&#160; pull the plug on the 1.2-billion-euro deal on the grounds Russia could use the Mistral-class helicopter carriers to threaten its Black Sea neighbors. France agreed to the sale under a 2011 contract, with the first vessel due in October and the second in 2015. &#160; The Mistral, the second-largest ship in the French navy, is a high-seas military base that can transport up to 16 helicopters, four landing craft, 60 armed vehicles and some 700 troops.

Its collapse appears inevitable and threatens to substantially contribute to global sea level rise. In order to make predictions about the future of the ice sheet and the impact it will have, scientists across different departments at the University of Washington are conducting multifaceted research.\n\nIt is alarmingly noted in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of IPCC's Working Group I (WG I) entitled “Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis” that the Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) has increased throughout the last 19th century, and past three decades have been warmer than all the previous decades followed by the warmest decade of the 2000's.\n\nIt indicates we are living in a warmer planet with emergent risks, and constant threats to well being. Currently, the UNEP Emissions Gap Assessment 2012 projects that if present emission trends continued, climate warming would reach the range of 3.5°C to 5°C by 2100 that would adversely affect our living planet. Growing thermal expansion leading to climate warming, however, is overwhelmingly expediting the melting and discharge of mountain glaciers and grand ice capes of Greenland, Antarctic and Himalaya that results into the sea level rise. Already, it is well documented that ocean thermal expansion and glacier mass loss are the predominant catalysts to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise during the last quarter of 20th century. Thermal expansion alone is projected to contribute over half of the average rise. Besides, the AR5 of IPCC (WG I) estimates that global glaciers (excluding the peripheral glaciers around Greenland and Antarctica) contributed to sea level rise of 0.25 to 1.00 mm yr–1 during 1971–2010. Based on tide gauge records and satellite data since 1993, it is estimated that GMSL has risen by 0.19 m over the period 1901 2010 and the likely mean rate of sea level rise was 1.7 mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010. And the rate was very higher at 3.2 mm yr–1 from 1993 to 2010. It is also projected in the AR5 that GMSL rise for 2081 2100 (relative to 1986–2005) will likely be in the 5–95% ranges.\n\nRising sea level, however, in conjunction with storm surges, flooding and erosion, acts as a threat multiplier to low lying Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the tropics and the subtropics which are home to more than 63 million people and places of outstanding natural beauty, rich ecosystems, biodiversity and dazzling landscapes. These island states include Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Samoa, Tobago, Tonga, Mauritius, Suriname, Maldives, Kiribati, Jamaica, Dominica, Barbados, Bahamas, Cape Verde that span the ocean regions of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic etc. Recent estimations indicate that the small island states are badly experiencing annual or frequent flooding, inundation, beaches erosion, salinization of freshwater aquifers, damage to coastal infrastructures and ecosystems due to global sea level rise that undoubtedly jeopardizes human security and long term sustainability. The islanders face considerable challenges to guarantee of material aspects of human security including access to alternative livelihoods, food security, housing, clean water, employment, health safety, and poverty alleviation. Furthermore, rising sea level and extreme events threaten to erode and engulf significant land areas and associated infrastructures and settlements of small island states.\n\nHuman security of island states is punctured by sea level rise and a range of extreme events such as tropical storms, sea surges, hurricanes, droughts, etc. Water supply is likely to be affected by these extreme events. Reduction in rainfall is likely to shrink surface and ground water availability whereas increased rainfall particularly in the form of torrential downpours is likely to produce landslides, beaches erosion, and damage of residential and commercial areas. Water scarcity will badly affect the viability of food and cereal production of small island states. Moreover, loss of land and growing beach erosion directly affect the countries' tourism sectors on which their national economy depends. It is estimated that, for instances, 45% of tourist resorts in Maldives face varying degrees of beach erosion and projected sea level rise would aggravate the current conditions, and rise by 1 m would even cause disappearance of entire Maldives. All human settlements, infrastructures and industries are close to shorelines that are often adversely affected by extreme climatic events, and the projected sea level rise even poses a decisive threat to the existence of these infrastructures.\n\nCoral reefs provide not just natural protection to islands but are also associated with main economic success like tourism, fisheries and local livelihood activities. It is expected that survival of coral reefs would be badly staked by rising sea level, and sea surface temperatures. The emerging threats to beaches, reefs, infrastructures, biodiversity and natural beauty of resort island countries would cause fall of tourism industries on which their state economy predominantly relies. The vulnerability of agricultural production and crisis of locally grown foods within islands might increase dependency on imported food items and threaten food security of island dwellers. Besides, poor sanitation of rural island communities would be affected by increasing rainfalls that might cause  waterborne diseases like diarrhea. Present state of health services and facilities would simply be inadequate if weather related diseases aggravate.\n\nFor Bangladesh, IPCC warned in the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of 2001 that 29,846 sq. km area of coastal land particularly Hatia, Sandweep, Maishkhali, St. Martin, Bhola and southern coasts will be lost, and 14.8 million people will be landless by 1 m sea level rise. Land loss expedites loss of agricultural fields, homesteads, infrastructures, biodiversity, communication and lifeline services etc. In 2001, the World Bank cautioned that the Sundarbans will be completely destroyed by 1 m sea level rise and life and livelihoods of forest dependent people will be jeopardized. The longest sea beach and tourist site of Cox's Bazar being highly exposed to anticipated sea level rise, might be destroyed.\n\nSimilarly, Kuakata and Patenga beaches are extremely vulnerable to projected rise that threatens country's tourism industry as all facilities are close to coastlines. Some decisive impacts of sea level rise for the people of Bangladesh are extreme salinity concentration in soil and water, damage of habitation and forests, fresh water crisis, eroding beach and coastal land, acute health hazards, loss of fisheries, agriculture and biodiversity etc. The World Bank projects that rice production would decrease by 0.2 million metric tons for salinity intrusion resulted from sea level rise.

The area of ice has declined by 49 per cent since 1979. The thermal expansion of the ocean leads to a rise in sea levels, Bala warned.  \"It could rise by a metre in this century. About 70 per cent of global coastlines will experience relative sea level change. Coastal regions could see a rise of 60 cm in sea levels\", he said. Bala said melting ice in the ocean does not contribute to sea level rise but ice capped mountains do. The entire ice sheet on Greenland is melting and Himalayan glaciers as well as glaciers like Andes are retreating, he noted. He said carbon dioxide levels are relentlessly rising in the atmosphere. From 1958 to 2013, carbon dioxide levels have increased by 100 parts per million (ppm). \"Last year, we crossed the 400 ppm mark, and this year we crossed it for about a week,\" he added.    Bala said the Indian monsoon has a great amount of inter annual variability.

His mother Audrey at least knows where Sam is now; he used to wander around and steal. (Photos: Oupa Nkosi)\n\nThe stale odour of marijuana hangs thick in the air, discarded beer bottles are littered around the entrance to *Sam Maseko’s room. \n\nInside the room the stench is overwhelming. It is dark, humid and cold. Scant light streams into the room through the small windows left open in the patched up wall that is sloppily covered with a floral curtain. Miscellaneous parts of household appliances are clustered in a corner of the room. \n\nOn top of a makeshift table, there is a handful of finely crushed marijuana next to a broken blade on a stained piece of paper with faded childlike drawings. Dagga seeds and used matchsticks are scattered on the uncovered mattress and all over the partially carpeted floor. The patchily painted walls are dirty; residual smoke lingers in the air.  \n\nSam (33) sits on the couch in the cluttered room. His light blue jeans are stained. \n\nDisorientated, he slowly licks his blackened lips. He is skinny and looks at least 10 years older than his current age. He rubs his eyes with soiled hands.  \n\n“He can stay like this for days,” says his mother, Audrey Maseko, waving her hands in frustration at him. “He just locks himself in his room and smokes this thing all day.” \n\nSam is addicted to nyaope, a street drug consisting mainly of dagga and heroin. Though the exact content of the drug is not known, other substances such as rat poison, milk powder or antiretroviral drugs used for HIV treatment are reportedly added to the mixture to enhance the effect of the drug. \n\nThis is strongly disputed by the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca), “as rat poison is toxic to humans”.  \n\nAlso known as “wunga”, the drug first emerged in the 2000s in the Pretoria townships of Soshanguve, Mamelodi and Atteridgeville, according to the justice department. \n\nIt has since gained popularity around the country, particularly in townships. \n\nNyaope is a cheap drug. According to Maseko a small, capsule size bag of white nyaope powder only costs about R50.  \n\nOperation Thiba Nyaope\n\nIn 2009 Maseko and other parents in Ivory Park whose children are addicted to nyaope formed Operation Thiba Nyaope [stop nyaope], a nongovernmental organisation that provides support to drug users and their families.  \n\n“We started this group because we were trying to find a way to save our children. But instead of helping us rehabilitate them, the government is threatening to send them to jail,” she says.  \n\nUntil recently nyaope was not classified as an illegal drug, making the prosecution of people arrested for selling or possession of the substance “legally impossible”.  \n\nBut earlier this year the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act was amended to include a ban on substances that contain “other prohibited drugs like heroin and dagga, as they are illegal”, a justice department statement reads.  \n\nPeople caught using nyaope can now be sentenced for up to 15 years. Those caught selling the concoction face up to 25 years in jail.  \n\nWithdrawal \n\nBut Maseko and the other members of her organisation say sentencing nyaope users will do them more harm than good. \n\n“Getting off nyaope is very dangerous. Addicts need to get the right treatment from the very first day they stop smoking.”  \n\nParents like Maseko believe that “if they [their children] are locked up for 15 years without getting the right treatment they will die in jail”.  \n\nBut Cathy Vos from Sanca says that, although withdrawal from the drug can cause excruciating pain, it is unlikely that someone could die from the symptoms, unless their immune system is already compromised by illness or infection. \n\n“The withdrawal symptoms can present as severe abdominal cramps, diarrhoea or flu like symptoms, which can last for four to six days after the patient has stopped using,” says Vos. \n\nSanca believes that classifying nyaope as an illegal drug “will lead to the arrest and conviction of people dealing in nyaope, thus reducing the availability of nyaope on the streets”.  \n\nBeatings and a clean stint\n\nBut getting arrested is the least of Sam’s worries. His mother fears that he will die at the hands of the people he has been stealing from. \n\n“Since he got into this thing my child started stealing from my neighbours, they would beat him up every other day. He’s been in and out of prison, but nothing ever changes,” says Maseko. \n\nIn an attempt to get away from the environment that has been fuelling his habit, Sam went to stay with relatives in Kimberley for a few months last year.  \n\n“When he came back [from Kimberley] he was clean. He was so handsome,” Maseko says tears welling up in her eyes. \n\n“There is no nyaope there so he couldn’t smoke it for three months. But the sad thing is that he just fell back into this thing.” \n\nThe one good thing that came out of the trip to Kimberley, she says, is that her son has secluded himself in his room.  \n\n“At least he doesn’t wander around stealing from people anymore,” says Maseko. \n\n“But now he is making nyaope with whatever he can get his hands on. He is an electrician so he often does work for people and undercharges them just so that he can get this thing [nyaope].” \n\nHaving her son at home gives Maseko a fragile sense of relief: at least she knows where he is. \n\n“I don’t know what to do any more, he doesn’t listen to me. I’m a single parent and he is a grown man.”  \n\nMissing son\n\nMonica Ndalwane lives just a block away from Maseko, also in Ivory Park. Her home is distinguished from those of most of her neighbours; it is big and elegant. \n\nPeople in her community call it the “Nigerian house” because of its resemblance to mansions they see in Nollywood movies. \n\nNdalwane’s children have everything they need, but this didn’t stop her son from developing a nyaope addiction.  \n\nUnlike Maseko, Ndalwane doesn’t know where her son is. She hasn’t seen or heard from him for several days. Just the week before a neighbour told Ndalwane that her son had broken into his home and that he has reported it the police. \n\n“Later that day the police came to my house looking for him,” she says, sniffing.  \n\nHe didn’t sleep at home that night, so the next day she went looking for him. “I found him just wandering the streets. So I put my arm over his shoulder and asked him where he sold the furniture he stole.  \n\n“He didn’t give me any trouble. He just showed me where he sold it.”  \n\nOperation Thiba Nyaope often recovers valuables stolen by nyaope addicts to protect them from being reported to the police. \n\nNdalwane and a member of their organisation recovered the stolen furniture from the people her son sold it to.  \n\n“I brought the furniture back home with me and called the police to come fetch it. I’ve made a statement with the police. Since then my child has run away from home. I don’t know where he is; he is hiding from the police.” \n\nNyaope in jail\n\nNdalwane says she doesn’t know whether or not she will hand her son over to the police if he makes contact with her. \n\n“I don’t think it is right to sentence nyaope addicts to 15 years in jail, because even now, the users here get arrested and spend about six months in jail, and when they come back they are worse.  \n\n“Nyaope is available in jail. So what does that help, because even if they are no longer in the same environment, they are still smoking,” says Ndalwane.  \n\n“When we started this organisation, I was really hopeful that we would be able to help our children – but we haven’t,” her voice breaks with emotion. \n\n“Instead of getting better he has gotten worse. We’ve sent him to rehab, but when he gets out he goes back to the same friends he has been smoking with and picks up the habit again.” \n\nRehab\n\nThe two main ingredients of the designer drug are why nyaope is so addictive. \n\n“Dagga and heroin are dependency forming. It doesn’t take a long time from when a person first uses heroin for them to become physically and emotionally dependant on the drug,” Vos says. \n\nThe severe withdrawal symptoms are the result of the dependence and a reason why users smoke continually is to curb the cravings.  \n\n“The emotional addiction translates into severe mood swings and feelings of insecurity and insomnia,” says Vos.  \n\nTreatment for nyaope addicts is symptomatic, so the patient will get drugs to relieve the cramps and diarrhoea, just like heroin addicts.  \n\n“Rehabilitation includes detoxing; patients are given medication for the withdrawal symptoms and vitamins, because while patients are on the high from the drug they don’t eat. They can pick up between eight to 12kg in rehab. Therapy is also a part of the rehabilitation process, to help the patient understand why they keep using,” she says. \n\nAlthough the drug will not be detected in their urine after 14 days, Sanca warns that “addiction is a relapsing disease” and that users often have to go for several rehabilitation treatments to learn to cope without the drug, a process that varies from one person to the next.  \n\nPatients are taught life skills and have to change friends and their way of life in general. “The hardest part is understanding what the triggers are,” says Vos.  \n\nThough Vos admits that there are not enough rehabilitation centres in South Africa to deal with the drug problem, she says people are also scared of seeking help because they fear being stigmatised or are unaware of the options available to them.  \n\nSouth Africa has 80 private drug rehabilitation centres, including those run by Sanca, and eight government facilities. Sanca’s nyaope addicts go to centres allocated to dealing with heroin or dagga addiction.  \n\nVos says: “Addiction is a treatable disease. So nyaope addicts can be successfully rehabilitated.” \n\nThe parents who are part of Operation Thiba Nyaope say they want to be granted a licence to function as a rehabilitation organisation so that they can “save their children from themselves”.  \n\nThe organisation says the only way they can solve their community’s problem is by helping their children to kick the habit themselves; all they need is for government to allocate land to them where they can provide a rehabilitation service. \n\nThe start\n\n“My spirit is broken. He is my only son and he has been doing this for years now,” says Ndalwane, her voice quivering as she holds back the tears. \n\nNdalwane’s son used to wake up every morning and go to school, but in 2003 when he was only 10 years old she heard rumours that he had stopped going to school. One day she decided to follow him to where he was going.  \n\n“When I got into the house he was hanging out at, there’s this table in the middle of the room with weed on it. At that time I didn’t know what nyaope is, but he was smoking it. \n\n“The next morning I went to the school and met with his class teacher who told me that the last time she saw him at school was in January when the schools opened. That time it was around November. He was in Grade 5. The class teacher never bothered to tell me that she didn’t see my child at school any more. They just kept quiet until I went to the school.” \n\nThe tissue in Ndalwane’s hands is soggy. Eleven years later, at the age of 21, her son is still addicted to nyaope.  \n\n“My life has never been the same since. I have high blood pressure and diabetes. Things at home are sour and his father blames it all on me. \n\n“My husband blames our son’s addiction on me. He says I am spoiling the child. But I don’t know what I am supposed to do – abandon him? He’s my child,” her voice breaks as tears stream down her face. \n\nAs if speaking to herself, Ndalwane mutters: “I can’t abandon him.”  She shakes her head, now sobbing uncontrollably. \n\n“I’m scared that people in the community will end up killing him. Breaking into people’s houses and stealing from them is going to get him killed.” \n\n*Not his real name\n\nPrivate hell: Nyaope addict Sam Maseko’s room. He spends his time locked up in here, smoking the drug and fixing appliances to make money for his habit.\n\nARV creates effects ‘consistent with LSD like activity’ \n\nNyaope is a drug that first emerged on the streets of townships around Pretoria in the early 2000s. Also known as “wunga”, it is sold as a tiny parcel of white powder for about R50. \n\nThe drug is a concoction of mainly heroin mixed with other white powders, such as milk powder, to bulk it up. The powder is combined with marijuana and smoked. \n\nOther substances such as antiretroviral (ARV) medications used to treat HIV are said to be added to the mixture to enhance the effect of the drug. \n\nReports of ARVs being added to nyaope started emerging in 2011 and 2012, with several doctors in Soweto reporting that their consultation rooms had been ransacked and HIV medication stolen. \n\nMedia reports cited HIV patients being robbed of their pills after collecting them from local clinics; others reported patients selling their ARVs to nyaope addicts or dealers.  \n\nWhen taken orally as prescribed, an ARV known as Efavirenz is associated with hallucinations, delusions and euphoria, according to the online HIV information service Aidsmap run by the United Kingdom based charity NAM publications. \n\nPeter Ucko, from South Africa’s Central Drug Authority (CDA), says that the idea that smoking ARVs would increase nyaope’s effect was most probably sparked by “rumours” and misconceptions. \n\nSome nyaope addicts also stole LCD screen televisions because they believed there was a powder behind the screen that could also be added to the concoction. \n\n“These are all criminal elements. There is no proof that smoking ARVs has any psychedelic effect,” he says.  \n\nBut after seeing a news report about the use of ARVs in nyaope, John Schetz, associate professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in the United States, conducted research into the effects of smoking Efavirenz.  \n\nHis findings, published in the international scientific journal Neuropsychopharmacology, showed that Efavirenz had ” [a] prevailing behavioural effect in rodents [that] is consistent with LSD like activity”. \n\nNo similar studies have been conducted on humans.  \n\nAccording to the South African National Council on Alcohol and Drug Dependence (Sanca), the main ingredients of nyaope – dagga and heroin – are dependency forming. \n\nA person on nyaope becomes both physically and psychologically addicted to the drug.  \n\nWhen addicts do not smoke, they will get severe withdrawal symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, stomach cramps and flu like symptoms. \n\n“The emotional addiction translates into severe mood swings and feelings of insecurity and insomnia,” says Cathy Vos from Sanca. \n\nParents of nyaope addicts say that their children have reported insomnia, “seeing things in the middle of the night”, severe mood swings and aggression.  \n\nExact figures on the extent of the use of nyaope are not available but Ucko says that there is “anecdotal evidence that shows that nyaope use has increased over the years”. \n\nHe says that a lot of the evidence about nyaope is collected from media reports and from what the CDA is told by various communities.  \n\nThough the name of the drug varies from place to place, Ucko says that the components of the mixture remain the same. \n\n“It is possible that there may be a similar concoction in other countries under different names, but nyaope is a South African name product.” \n\nUcko says the change in the names of the drugs is part of a ploy by drug dealers to make their product sound appealing. \n\nThe social development department’s National Drug Master Plan 2013 2017 states the use of a “poly drug is meant to enhance the effect of the specific drugs on the individual or, in certain cases, to disguise or conceal the use of a specific drug.  \n\n“In addition, it is common for drugs, especially combinations of drugs, to be given local or street names. In South Africa the street names and the combinations differ from province to province and region to region, and change from time to time.” \n\nEFF protest Parliament's medical aid rates despite R1m salary?\n\nThe EFF are facing a major test when it comes to parliamentary benefits but is it just hypocrisy at play, or the seduction of institutionalised power?\n\n​Game of Thrones: Winter is here\n\nWith apologies to creator George RR Martin and anyone else to whom we couldn't pay royalties, the M&G parodies Game of Thrones with SA politics.\n\nAfrica is still waiting for the dawn\n\nThe doctor who walked away Desperate search for answers to schizophrenia puzzle Comment: The cost malady; Foresight is 2020 Free State health dept could face national takeover\n\nThe doctor who walked away Desperate search for answers to schizophrenia puzzle Free State health dept could face national takeover Comment: The cost malady; Foresight is 2020\n\nSubscriptions","status":"MINED","properties":{"keywords":{"main":["drug","hiv","south africa","operation thiba nyaope","son","sam maseko","lsb","addicts","heroin","addiction","arvs","thing","room","national council","children","smoking","drugs","ivory park","topics","pretoria","drug dependence","free state","rehabilitation","police","jail","time","symptoms","powder","day","school"]},"basic_stats":{"ave_sent_per_par":1.543859601020813,"total_sentences":176,"avg_token_frequency":2.134387254714966,"avg_entity_frequency":3.4482758045196533,"quality_score":65,"total_tokens":3207,"text_length":4,"ave_tok_per_sent":18,"read_time_est":13,"avg_token_weight":0.6042994856834412,"total_paragraphs":114},"job_meta":{"doc_source_name":"Mail & Guardian Index Feed","doc_title":"We need to talk about caving in to nyaope","doc_source_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_published_date":1402022220000,"doc_source_feed_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_description":"Ivory Park's Operation Thiba Nyaope provides support for addicts and their affected families."},"social_stats":{"total":0,"fb_share":0,"linkedin":0,"reddit":0,"fb_comments":0,"fb_likes":0,"date":1402026274648,"fb_click":0,"googleplus":0,"fb_total":0,"stumbleupon":0,"twitter":0,"pinterest":0},"meta":{"job_start_date":1402026262803,"doc_source_name":"The M&G Online","date":1402026262803,"job_type":"feed_url","doc_url":"http://mg.co.za/article/2014-06-06-we-need-to-talk-about-caving-in-to-nyaope/","extractor":"feed_url","doc_aggregated_date":1402026262778,"doc_description":"We need to talk about caving in to nyaope","doc_twitter_username":"","job_target":"MINE","doc_author":"Ina Skosana","doc_source_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","doc_type":"article","doc_fingerprint":"3b7c4dc5f1090f90d39ea63d374bc5b66c1b2d573fd313ce35277576c1c2f3c1","job_processors_applied":35,"multilingual":true,"doc_keywords":"Topics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnyaope\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmarijuana\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theroin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrug addiction\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrug abuse","boilerpipe_extractor":"low_canola","main_language":"en","doc_source_feed_url":"http://mg.co.za/rss/","url_fingerprint":"23e1d5eb8ce3c59e730e3e82cfd0763397b6ab849346ea2d24983f6bacf466a7","doc_title":"We need to talk about caving in to nyaope","doc_published_date":1402022220000,"doc_image":"http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2014/06/06/audreymasekoonline_landscape.jpg/676x380/","customer_id":"2c7f9a","job_id":"53913916835b63f20312bbbf","job_duration_ms":11846}},"entities":[{"surface_alt":"Central Drug Authority","citations":27,"uid":"499d6a222fc05ec30e052a7aa8eaa5a066491903","class":"http://schema.org/Place","type":"PLACE","desc":null,"label":"Central Drug Authority","confidence":0.4000000059604645,"surface":"drug","id":"RAW:central drug authority"},{"citations":3,"uid":"52d69447224b99edea9d3857ab2fcc43614d97cb","class":"http://schema.org/Person","type":"PERSON","desc":null,"label":"Sam Maseko","confidence":0.4000000059604645,"surface":"Sam Maseko","id":"RAW:sam maseko"},{"citations":1,"uid":"7f72ae98b497fb490ae2b503b8bdbb6186205f01","class":"http://schema.org/Person","desc":"Audrey Hepburn (born Audrey Kathleen Ruston; 4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British actress and humanitarian.

She was 93.\n\nKochiyama's family said she died in her sleep on Sunday.\n\nAmong her many accomplishments during 50 years of work, Kochiyama's activism led directly to the US Senate's agreement to pay reparations and apologize to Japanese Americans and others who were interred during the World War II.\n\nKochiyama was living in New York when she forged an unlikely bond with Malcolm X, and she witnessed his 1965 assassination in New York.\n\nKochiyama was born in San Pedro, California, to a middle class family. She and her family were interred for two years in Arkansas during World War II. After the war, she moved to New York and married her husband, Bill, who died in 1993.\n\nAfter her release at the war's conclusion, Kochiyama dedicated her life to social activism that spanned races, nationalities and causes, including vocal opposition of the Vietnam War and anti apartheid policies in South Africa while supporting independence for Puerto Rico.\n\n\"Her tireless dedication to civil rights helped inspire generations of activists, including within the American Muslim community,\" the California chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations said in a statement. \"She will be fondly remembered by all those of us who continue to defend civil liberties and promote justice.\"\n\nThe mother of six was living in New York's Harlem neighbourhood when she forged an unlikely bond with Malcolm X in the 1960s. She was sitting in the front row of the Audubon Ballroom Auditorium in New York when assassins burst in and gunned him down.\n\nThe California assembly adjourned in Kochiyama's memory on Thursday.\n\nKochiyama is the author of a memoir, \"Passing It On\", and is survived by four of her children and several grandchildren.\n\nCharacters Remaining: 3000\n\nRefrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

familiar with.\"\n\nWilliams is Director of Business Development at quantum computing company D Wave Systems, as well as an author, researcher, and noted thinker in the field in his own

instantly changes the other, even though they're separated by some distance.\n\n\"For the longest time people said entanglement was the gold standard — 'Until you show this, you don't have a quantum computer.' So this is a major step for the field as a whole,\" said Williams. \"I like to describe it in the context of the memory register of a [classical] computer. Whatever operation you perform doesn't have a side effect on the bits you don't touch, but quantum bits affect each other even though you didn't touch them.\"\n\nQuantum computers are those that draw their computational power from the quirks of the quantum world. Rather than using classical computer bits, which represent either a one or a zero and enable every single thing your computer does today, they use quantum bits (called qubits) that can represent a one, zero, or any value in between, all at once.

A qubit's curious properties are simply an extension of these quantum quirks.\n\nQuantum computers will prove themselves most useful in the arena of optimization. The go to example of an optimization problem is that of a hypothetical traveling salesman who needs to visit several cities while traveling as short a distance as possible. Classical non quantum computers can solve this quite inefficiently by way of brute force, chugging away for the optimal solution by manually checking every possible route configuration, then returning the shortest one.

Dow Jones says it's expected to price the stock at $43, well above its initial $36-$40 range .\n\nInvestors probably like the fact that Arista is already profitable and growing nicely. Revenues nearly doubled from $193.4 million in 2012 to $361.2 million in 2013, and in that same time profits doubled, too, from $21.4 million to $42.5 million.\n\nPlus, Arista has some huge customers, and it plays in a hot market, corporate computer network equipment, an area that is undergoing a lot of change. That change has been good for Arista, whose CEO, Jayshree Ullal, was one of the top engineers at the rival Cisco, before Arista lured her away .\n\nHowever, the company is also embroiled in a double dose of controversy: an odd lawsuit by one of its co founders and accusations of offering stock to journalists.\n\nArista was founded by billionaires and close friends David Cheriton and Andy Bechtolsheim , who famously provided seed money to Google in 1998. (The story goes: they viewed a demo of a project from two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and promptly each cut a check for $100,000.)\n\nBechtolsheim is perhaps best known as a co founder of Sun who went on to fund a lot of other successful tech companies. Cheriton is known as \"Professor Billionaire,\" is tenured at Stanford, and has taught and advised countless tech bigwigs.\n\nBut buried in the IPO paperwork , Arista revealed that Cheriton had left the company in March and that another startup he founded, OptumSoft, was threatending to sue. In April, the suit was filed.\n\n“In a way, he’s suing himself. I’ve never seen that before,” University of Houston law professor Ray Nimmer told Forbes' Ryan Mac and Alex Konrad.\n\nThe two don't disagree on this part: Arista used OptumSoft's software to create Arista's products. The dispute centers on what parts of Arista's software OptumSoft can now lay claim to because of that.\n\nIf the outcome of the lawsuit gives OptumSoft rights to a lot of Arista's software, then Arista could be in deep trouble. OptumSoft's business model is to license software to many companies. That means it could license Arista's secret sauce to its competitors, giving away Arista's competitive advantage.\n\nGiven Cheriton's relationship to Arista, this suit may be about something other than money.\n\nOptumSoft didn't flourish as Arista did (it has 25 employees to Arista's 850+). Over time, Cheriton's influence at Arista waned as he was able to devote limited time to it while meeting his obligations at Stanford, Forbes reports.\n\nMeanwhile OptumSoft represents a labor of love for Cheriton, the culmination of a lifetime of research on how to build large cloud computer systems. He has a big personal commitment to it. It may be more important to him to take a stand on a situation he thinks is unfair to OptumSoft, even though that stand could hurt the IPO and his own pocketbook.\n\nIn between all of this Arista suffered another controversy. It came under fire about a month ago when tech journalist Adam Lashinsky revealed that Arista offered him pre IPO shares of the stock. In other words, Arista was trying to bribe him and other tech journalists, as our own Henry Blodget described it.\n\nWe've reached out to OptumSoft for comment.

Dow Jones says it's expected to price the stock at $43, well above its initial $36-$40 range .\n\nInvestors probably like the fact that Arista is already profitable and growing nicely. Revenues nearly doubled from $193.4 million in 2012 to $361.2 million in 2013, and in that same time profits doubled, too, from $21.4 million to $42.5 million.\n\nPlus, Arista has some huge customers, and it plays in a hot market, corporate computer network equipment, an area that is undergoing a lot of change. That change has been good for Arista, whose CEO, Jayshree Ullal, was one of the top engineers at the rival Cisco, before Arista lured her away .\n\nHowever, the company is also embroiled in a double dose of controversy: an odd lawsuit by one of its co founders and accusations of offering stock to journalists.\n\nArista was founded by billionaires and close friends David Cheriton and Andy Bechtolsheim , who famously provided seed money to Google in 1998. (The story goes: they viewed a demo of a project from two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and promptly each cut a check for $100,000.)\n\nBechtolsheim is perhaps best known as a co founder of Sun who went on to fund a lot of other successful tech companies. Cheriton is known as \"Professor Billionaire,\" is tenured at Stanford, and has taught and advised countless tech bigwigs.\n\nBut buried in the IPO paperwork , Arista revealed that Cheriton had left the company in March and that another startup he founded, OptumSoft, was threatending to sue. In April, the suit was filed.\n\n“In a way, he’s suing himself. I’ve never seen that before,” University of Houston law professor Ray Nimmer told Forbes' Ryan Mac and Alex Konrad.\n\nThe two don't disagree on this part: Arista used OptumSoft's software to create Arista's products. The dispute centers on what parts of Arista's software OptumSoft can now lay claim to because of that.\n\nIf the outcome of the lawsuit gives OptumSoft rights to a lot of Arista's software, then Arista could be in deep trouble. OptumSoft's business model is to license software to many companies. That means it could license Arista's secret sauce to its competitors, giving away Arista's competitive advantage.\n\nGiven Cheriton's relationship to Arista, this suit may be about something other than money.\n\nOptumSoft didn't flourish as Arista did (it has 25 employees to Arista's 850+). Over time, Cheriton's influence at Arista waned as he was able to devote limited time to it while meeting his obligations at Stanford, Forbes reports.\n\nMeanwhile OptumSoft represents a labor of love for Cheriton, the culmination of a lifetime of research on how to build large cloud computer systems. He has a big personal commitment to it. It may be more important to him to take a stand on a situation he thinks is unfair to OptumSoft, even though that stand could hurt the IPO and his own pocketbook.\n\nIn between all of this Arista suffered another controversy. It came under fire about a month ago when tech journalist Adam Lashinsky revealed that Arista offered him pre IPO shares of the stock. In other words, Arista was trying to bribe him and other tech journalists, as our own Henry Blodget described it.\n\nWe've reached out to OptumSoft for comment. Arista tells us it is still in its quiet period and cannot comment.\n\nAs Arista Networks Marches Toward An IPO, One Of Its Billionaire Founders Is Suing It\n\n7 Daily Rituals Of Highly Effective Leaders\n\nMore \"Moving Forward\" »\n\nMore \"Monday Scouting Report\" »\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nHere Are The Running Accessories Actually Worth Buying\n\nE Commerce And The Future Of Retail 2014 [SLIDE DECK]\n\nBeacons: What They Are, How They're Used For Payments And Retail, And Why Apple's Ahead\n\n* Copyright © 2014 Business Insider Inc.

The dispute centers on what parts of Arista's software OptumSoft can now lay claim to because of that.</p> <p>If the outcome of the lawsuit gives OptumSoft rights to a lot of Arista's software, then Arista could be in deep trouble. OptumSoft's business model is to license software to many companies. That means it could license Arista's secret sauce to its competitors, giving away Arista's competitive advantage.</p> <p>Given Cheriton's relationship to Arista, this suit may be about something other than money.</p> <p>OptumSoft didn't flourish as Arista did (it has 25 employees to Arista's 850+). Over time, Cheriton's influence at Arista waned as he was able to devote limited time to it while meeting his obligations at Stanford, Forbes reports.</p> <p>Meanwhile OptumSoft represents a labor of love for Cheriton, the culmination of a lifetime of research on how to build large cloud computer systems. He has a big personal commitment to it. It may be more important to him to take a stand on a situation he thinks is unfair to&nbsp;OptumSoft, even though that stand could hurt the IPO and his own pocketbook.</p> <p>Or he could be holding out for a bigger settlement from Arista.</p> <p>In between all of this Arista suffered another controversy. It came under fire about a month ago when tech journalist Adam Lashinsky revealed that Arista offered him pre-IPO shares of the stock. In other words, Arista was trying to bribe him and other tech journalists, as our own <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-give-journalists-stock-2014-5\">Henry Blodget described it.</a></p> <p>So, like we said, Arista's IPO will be interesting to watch.</p> <p>We've reached out to OptumSoft for comment. Arista tells us it is still in its quiet period and cannot comment.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/most-valuable-enterprise-tech-companies-2014-5\" >The 20 Most Valuable Enterprise Tech Companies In The World</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/controversy-surrounds-arista-ipo-2014-6#comments\">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p>"},"social_stats":{"total":4,"fb_share":0,"linkedin":0,"reddit":0,"fb_comments":0,"fb_likes":0,"date":1402016123415,"fb_click":0,"googleplus":0,"fb_total":0,"stumbleupon":0,"twitter":4,"pinterest":0},"meta":{"job_start_date":1402016103603,"doc_source_name":"Business Insider","date":1402016103603,"doc_description_quality":"NORMAL","job_type":"feed_url","doc_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/controversy-surrounds-arista-ipo-2014-6","extractor":"feed_url","doc_aggregated_date":1402016094491,"doc_description":"As Arista Networks marches toward an IPO, it's embroiled in a double dose of controversy including an odd lawsuit from one of the co-founders.","doc_twitter_username":"bi_enterprise","job_target":"MINE","doc_source_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/moneygame/contributor","doc_type":"article","doc_fingerprint":"b27a5041c4fab5c8655a173fb7c3709d93a268b5ddccc707b0f587774558c658","job_processors_applied":35,"multilingual":false,"doc_keywords":"Arista Networks, IPOs, Lawsuits, Computer networking, Julie Bort,","boilerpipe_extractor":"low_canola","main_language":"en","doc_source_feed_url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/moneygame/contributor.rss","url_fingerprint":"defb26c219bc9e5d76398948ab1b09c9f8b3df1cbfa288a2ccfc25a839920eda","doc_title":"As Arista Networks Marches Toward An IPO, One Of Its Billionaire Founders Is Suing It","doc_published_date":1402015699000,"doc_image":"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5390f7dfeab8ea935dfa0a33/as-arista-networks-marches-toward-an-ipo-one-of-its-billionaire-founders-is-suing-it.jpg","customer_id":"2c7f9a","job_id":"5391115c835b63f20312bbab","job_duration_ms":19813}},"entities":[{"surface_alt":"marches","citations":3,"uid":"e6658cb9b51ef5cab31b94da28fead9762750bf3","class":"http://schema.org/Organization","type":"ORGANIZATION","desc":null,"label":"Arista Networks Marches","confidence":0.4000000059604645,"surface":"Arista Networks Marches","id":"RAW:arista networks marches"},{"citations":3,"uid":"8bc315a752ce75787bd58789c39c5aa8b3e80cf7","class":"http://schema.org/Organization","desc":"Arista Networks (previously Arastra) is a computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA.

Ignatius of The Washington Post that Edward Snowden took fewer top secret NSA documents than previously estimated.\n\nThe United States  intelligence community now thinks that the former systems administrator gave 200,000 to journalists in Hong Kong and had \"probably downloaded\" up to 1.5 million documents more — revised down from the previous estimate of 1.77 million.\n\nIt's unclear what the alleged documents contain: Top officials have said that the overwhelming majority of information Snowden took pertained to the United States  military capabilities , but Ignatius reports that officials don't think Snowden \"compromised the communications networks that make up the military’s command and control system.\"\n\nIn October, James Risen of The New York Times spoke with the 30 year old over encrypted chat and \"Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow, and did not keep any copies for himself.\"\n\nBut on June 12, 2013, two days after the 30 year old parted ways with American journalists Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald, Snowden  told  the South China Morning Post he had access to more documents to leak: \"If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment.\"\n\nFurther muddying the picture, Snowden told Brian Williams last month that the best way to make sure the Russians wouldn't be able to compromise the information \"was by destroying the material that I was holding before I transited through Russia.\"\n\nSnowden landed in Moscow on June 23 with a revoked passport and an invalid travel document, and the former CIA technician has been living in an undisclosed location since being granted asylum on August 1.\n\nSignificantly, Ignatius reports that \"the door still appears to be open for Snowden to negotiate some process under which he would return to the United States from Russia and face charges.\"\n\nBen Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisors, has  said  that Snowden \"does not believe that the ‘felon’ label is the right word for someone whose act of conscience has revitalized democratic oversight of the intelligence community and is leading to historic reforms.”\n\n“If he came back and told everything he knows, then perhaps some accommodation could be reached,” a senior official  told the Post , noting that plea negotiations \"are difficult if you start by saying you’re a hero and wanting a parade.\"\n\n7 Daily Rituals Of Highly Effective

British Prime Minister David Cameron is in the background.\n\nCharles Dharapak/AP\n\nPresident Obama at the news conference in Brussels at which he was asked if he had second thoughts about how he and his aides handled the Bergdahl deal announcement. British Prime Minister David Cameron is in the background.\n\nCharles Dharapak/AP\n\nWhile White House officials are keeping a brave face. President Obama and his top aides obviously have a political firestorm on their hands, owing not only to the particular details of the prisoner exchange involving Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and five senior Taliban officials but how they informed Congress and the public.\n\nNot that the president is yet willing to admit that publicly.\n\nDuring Obama's European trip on Thursday, a journalist asked him if \"in retrospect, do you think you could have done more to confer with Congress or announced the deal in a way that might have spared [Bergdahl] and his family being caught up in the political crossfire?\"\n\nThe president didn't really say what he and his aides might have done differently. Instead, he said: \"We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated and we were deeply concerned about. And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nThere was nothing in the president's answer suggesting that he thought he and his team could have done a better job handling what has indisputably become an election year mess.\n\nBut some aspects of how Obama and his team told the world about the Bergdahl trade have raised eyebrows , even among congressional allies, prompting questions like: What were they thinking? And that's without even going into the national security substance of releasing top Taliban officials.\n\n\"They've done a pretty poor job,\" says James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \"It just seems like error after error after error. In a communications strategy, you've got to anticipate who's going to criticize you and why and have some strong arguments for it and they didn't even have that.\"\n\nWhat makes this even more surprising is this is a presidency in its sixth year, not its first.\n\nHere are just three ways the administration has hurt its case.\n\nThe Rose Garden: Obama's appearance with the parents on Saturday quickly became problematic, to put it mildly. By standing with the Bergdahls at the White House, Obama wrapped the freed soldier and his parents in the presidency's prestige.\n\nUnfortunately, given the dubious circumstances of the sergeant's disappearance, that quickly raised questions in many minds about what White House officials were thinking. That Bob Bergdahl, the soldier's father, spoke some words in Pashtun, the language of his son's captors, only added to the head scratching.\n\nIt turns out, there was an element of serendipity to the Bergdahls' winding up in the Rose Garden. They had been in touch with White House officials over the years and were in Washington for the Memorial Day weekend. The deal that resulted in their son's release came together while they were still in town. It was Obama's personal decision to have them at the White House event, which may tell us everything we need to know. When a president wants his staff to make something happen, they tend to get it done though it might not be the wisest course.\n\nSusan Rice: The problems here can be summed up in six words: \"Benghazi talking points ... honor and distinction.\" The national security adviser, who for conservatives became the face of an alleged administration coverup of the facts behind the 2012 attacks in Libya, is in a familiar tight spot. Her credibility was widely questioned again because of her claim, again on a Sunday news show, that Bergdahl served honorably despite White House officials' awareness that members of Bergdahl's unit were saying otherwise. Given that, how could she make that claim and leave the impression of an Obama White House disconnected from reality?\n\nShifting rationales: Obama and White House officials have given various explanations for why they felt forced to move so quickly to trade Bergdahl for the five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay without first telling Congress as required by law. They were afraid of a leak that could harm the deal. Bergdahl's health was rapidly deteriorating. They had made Congress aware of negotiations taking place as far back as 2011.\n\nLittle of that was cutting it with the president's allies on Capitol Hill, let alone his Republican opponents. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D Calif., for instance, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wasn't buying the excuses that Congress was notified early in the process or that there wasn't enough time to tell key members right before the deal was announced.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she said: \"I think that they expected everybody just to fall in line. A lot could have been avoided had we been called and advised and talked with.\"\n\nHow badly has the administration damaged itself? \"On the Bergdahl thing, it's going to be very hard to recover,\" Thurber said. \"It's going to be hard to build trust with Feinstein and [Michigan Democrat Sen. Carl] Levin and other people he needs to be close to on the Senate side.\"\n\nIf there's some other part of the deal with the Taliban that only Obama knows about, and that Americans will eventually learn of, that serves the nation's security interests, that could help, Thurber said.\n\n\"But it's going to be very hard, especially just before an election; it's pretty tough,\" he said. \"There are a lot of Democrats in the Senate who are going to run away from this. And from him.\"\n\nYou must be signed in to leave a comment. Sign In / Register\n\nPlease keep your community civil.

Clinton is widely considered the Democratic front runner if she enters the 2016 White House race.\n\nWith controversy swirling over Obama's move to swap five Taliban militants held at the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for captive US army sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the book discloses that a much earlier discussion about him took place among top foreign policy advisers, including Clinton.\n\n\"I acknowledged, as I had many times before, that opening the door to negotiations with the Taliban would be hard to swallow for many Americans after so many years of war,\" she wrote.\n\nThe excerpts published by CBS News also reveal Clinton's disagreement with Obama over his decision not to arm Syrian rebels fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.\n\n\"The President's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels. No one likes to lose a debate, including me,\" Clinton wrote.\n\nIn a speech last week, Obama said he would increase support for the Syrian opposition, but he did not provide details.\n\nClinton's book, a memoir of her tenure at the State Department, is being published by Simon and Schuster, a unit of CBS' parent company, CBS Corp. She will then launch a high profile book tour across the country.\n\nRussia reset?\n\nAs the top US diplomat from 2009 to 2013, Clinton also acknowledged making a linguistic misstep in declaring a \"reset\" in American relations with Russia.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in March has raised questions about the so called reset.\n\nIn the book, Clinton calls Russian President Vladimir Putin \"thin skinned and autocratic, resenting criticism and eventually cracking down on dissent and debate.\"\n\nIn March, she drew parallels at a closed door fundraiser between Putin's actions and those of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler before World War Two. She later backtracked from those comments.\n\nAsked in an interview on Wednesday about Clinton's comments comparing him with Hitler, Putin said: \"It's better not to argue with women.\n\n\"When people push boundaries too far, it's not because they are strong but because they are weak. But maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman,\" he added.\n\nClinton also addressed her experiences surrounding the 2012 attacks on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, saying: \"There will never be perfect clarity on everything that happened.\"\n\nRepublican critics have condemned her handling of the incident, in which four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.\n\nThe book also details Clinton's meeting with Obama after she lost the Democratic presidential nomination to him in 2008.\n\n\"We stared at each other like two teenagers on an awkward first date, taking a few sips of Chardonnay,\" she writes.\n\nCharacters Remaining: 3000\n\nRefrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

The phenomenon soon spread to San Jose, California,   Los Angeles, and  even to New York .  \n\nThe man told local news station KTVU that he \"is just doing this as a social experiment for good, that he wants to give back.\" He has a friend who is helping him do the drops, since it's a pretty big undertaking.\n\nBut other than the fact that he made his millions in real estate, nobody knew anything about the mystery do gooder.\n\nThe TV show \"Inside Edition\" thinks it's cracked the case. In a clip that air's tonight, the show's Jim Moret got on the phone with someone claiming to be the man behind @HiddenCash, and asked him if he's Jason Buzi. When asked if he's Buzi, the mystery man said no.\n\nHowever, \"Listening closely to his voice and comparing it to the voice of Jason Buzi which we found on a real estate podcast, they sure do sound the same.\"\n\nCheck out the podcast for yourself and compare it to Buzi's voice below:\n\nThat bit of evidence isn't very conclusive, of course, so take it with a grain of salt. But there's other evidence out there that seems to point to Buzi as being the guy.\n\nFor one, Buzi ran CashTomato.com, a video website that was similar to YouTube, that gave away cash prizes every week. And even gave money to people who simply signed up for the site.  He also hid tomatoes all over San Francisco and New York , that people would have to find in exchange for money. But it caused people to riot  and was eventually shut down. \n\nThat lines up with his explanation for wanting to remain anonymous. \"There are a few reasons I would like to keep my privacy,\" the man behind @HiddenCash told SFGate . \"One, some people close to me wouldn't like that I am giving money away. Two, I enjoy having my privacy. Three, (I) had some publicity before and nothing good ever resulted from it.\"\n\nAs SFist points out :\n\nBuzi's LinkedIn profile  is strikingly similar to the @HiddenCash M.O. as well: \"In addition to real estate investing, Jason Buzi tries to be involved in the community and give back to those less fortunate. He has volunteered in East Palo Alto as a mentor and is an active donor to the East Palo Alto Kids Foundation. He is currently working with refugee families through the International Rescue Committee.\"\n\nRegardless of whether Buzi is the man behind @HiddenCash, or whether it's someone else, one thing is certain: things don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. He said that he plans to continue hiding money \"with no end in sight.\" And there's already at least one copycat money dropper  in the U.K.,  San Antonio , Chicago , \n\nAnd based on a comment left on a Business Insider story claiming to be from the guy behind @HiddenCash, more United States  cities are coming soon:\n\n7 Daily Rituals Of Highly Effective Leaders\n\nMore \"Moving Forward\" »\n\nMore \"Monday Scouting Report\" »\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nHere Are The Running Accessories Actually Worth Buying\n\nE Commerce And The Future Of Retail 2014 [SLIDE DECK]\n\nBeacons: What They Are, How They're Used For Payments And Retail, And Why Apple's Ahead\n\n* Copyright © 2014 Business Insider Inc.

The phenomenon soon spread to San Jose, California,   Los Angeles, and  even to New York .  \n\nThe man told local news station KTVU that he \"is just doing this as a social experiment for good, that he wants to give back.\" He has a friend who is helping him do the drops, since it's a pretty big undertaking.\n\nBut other than the fact that he made his millions in real estate, nobody knew anything about the mystery do gooder.\n\nThe TV show \"Inside Edition\" thinks it's cracked the case. In a clip that air's tonight, the show's Jim Moret got on the phone with someone claiming to be the man behind @HiddenCash, and asked him if he's Jason Buzi. When asked if he's Buzi, the mystery man said no.\n\nHowever, \"Listening closely to his voice and comparing it to the voice of Jason Buzi which we found on a real estate podcast, they sure do sound the same.\"\n\nCheck out the podcast for yourself and compare it to Buzi's voice below:\n\nThat bit of evidence isn't very conclusive, of course, so take it with a grain of salt. But there's other evidence out there that seems to point to Buzi as being the guy.\n\nFor one, Buzi ran CashTomato.com, a video website that was similar to YouTube, that gave away cash prizes every week. And even gave money to people who simply signed up for the site.  He also hid tomatoes all over San Francisco and New York , that people would have to find in exchange for money. But it caused people to riot  and was eventually shut down. \n\nThat lines up with his explanation for wanting to remain anonymous. \"There are a few reasons I would like to keep my privacy,\" the man behind @HiddenCash told SFGate . \"One, some people close to me wouldn't like that I am giving money away. Two, I enjoy having my privacy. Three, (I) had some publicity before and nothing good ever resulted from it.\"\n\nAs SFist points out :\n\nBuzi's LinkedIn profile  is strikingly similar to the @HiddenCash M.O. as well: \"In addition to real estate investing, Jason Buzi tries to be involved in the community and give back to those less fortunate. He has volunteered in East Palo Alto as a mentor and is an active donor to the East Palo Alto Kids Foundation. He is currently working with refugee families through the International Rescue Committee.\"\n\nRegardless of whether Buzi is the man behind @HiddenCash, or whether it's someone else, one thing is certain: things don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. He said that he plans to continue hiding money \"with no end in sight.\" And there's already at least one copycat money dropper  in the U.K.,  San Antonio , Chicago , \n\nAnd based on a comment left on a Business Insider story claiming to be from the guy behind @HiddenCash, more United States  cities are coming soon:\n\n7 Daily Rituals Of Highly Effective Leaders\n\nMore \"Moving Forward\" »\n\nMore \"Monday Scouting Report\" »\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nYour Activity |\n\nOptions\n\nHere Are The Running Accessories Actually Worth Buying\n\nE Commerce And The Future Of Retail 2014 [SLIDE DECK]\n\nBeacons: What They Are, How They're Used For Payments And Retail, And Why Apple's Ahead\n\n* Copyright © 2014 Business Insider Inc.

The company developed relationships with 15,000 different electronic DJs to stream their sets through the company’s service. Now, with the launch of Clubcast, Mixify is reaching out to venue owners and event promoters to bring an interactive experience to their clubs using any DJ on the Mixify roster.\n\nUsing Clubcast, venues can stream interactive DJ sets where club goers can watch the DJs perform. Already the company has arranged events with DJs like Tommy Trash, Bassjackers and Firebeatz in locations from Buenos Aires to the Cayman Islands. The company expects to be selling the Clubcast service in 40 markets by August of this year.\n\n“Mixify Clubcast is sold on a per event  basis,” says Mixify founder David Moricca. “In many cases we’re doing booking of a big name DJ as part of the service. it works particularly well for markets where they don’t have the market to support booking for these acts or the access.”\n\nGlobally, electronic dance music pulls in at least $15 billion, and much of that revenue is generated from electronic dance festivals that continue to gain attendees even as other music festivals have seen their numbers decline, Morrica. “Live events are a growing part of the music industry,” he says. “And EDM is the fastest growing. Demand for DJs way outstrips supply.”\n\nThe company’s thesis about the growth of electronic dance music has grabbed the attention of investors like Jamie Olsen of the Australian investment firm CMB Capital; Tim McGee and Richard Mergler of the music distribution and promotion company Ministry of Sound Australia; and Tommy Trash who is also a producer.\n\nAll told Mixify has raised $1.8 million for its service.\n\n“The focus is really on growing Clubcast sales and marketing — particularly on the international level. It’s about them growing the brand and growing the sales pipeline.”\n\nThrough Mixify’s Australian partners, the company is hoping to expand its customer base in key markets like Singapore and Hong Kong. There’s a profusion of talented DJs in the United States  and Western Europe, but demand is coming from the Asian markets that the company hopes to penetrate, says Moricca.","status":"MINED","properties":{"keywords":{"main":["daft punk","techcrunch","mixify launches clubcast","djs","mixify","company","tommy trash","clubcast","service","music","buenos aires","sound","markets","david moricca","united states","hong kong","dance","cayman islands","western europe","jamie olsen","richard mergler","ministry","tim mcgee","singapore","nook tablets","seattle tc pitch","capital","event","demand","stream"]},"basic_stats":{"ave_sent_per_par":1.7692307233810425,"total_sentences":23,"avg_token_frequency":1.6407185792922974,"avg_entity_frequency":1.1739130020141602,"quality_score":55,"total_tokens":508,"text_length":4,"ave_tok_per_sent":22,"read_time_est":2,"avg_token_weight":0.639114499092102,"total_paragraphs":13},"job_meta":{"doc_source_feed_url":"http://techcrunch.com/feed/","doc_source_name":"TechCrunch","doc_title":"Mixify Launches Clubcast To Bring Daft Punk To Your House","doc_source_url":"http://techcrunch.com","doc_published_date":1402010572000,"doc_description_quality":"NORMAL","doc_description":"<img width=\"680\" height=\"239\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mixify-1.jpg?w=680\" class=\"attachment-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Mixify 1\" />&nbsp;Daft Punk may not actually be playing at your house, but startup company Mixify has launched a new service, called Clubcast, and raised initial capital to bring DJs from around the world to your club or event.

So the ECB policymakers adjust interest rates in ways that can help keep wages and prices moving along on a very gentle upward slope.\n\nSince the Great Recession slammed into Europe more than five years ago, that goal has been hard to achieve. With unemployment still so high in so many countries, European employers have not seen any need to raise wages to keep or attract workers.\n\nAnd at the same time, consumers haven't had much money to spend, so prices have been depressed. When prices start falling, consumers hold back even more on their spending, waiting for goods to keep getting cheaper. This deflationary pattern can create a downward spiral for the whole economy.\n\nRight now, inflation is running at around 0.5 percent in the euro area, approaching stall speed. So the ECB is determined to get the economy moving fast enough to get wages and prices to perk up too.\n\nThat brings us to Thursday's announcement. The ECB said that from now on, if a bank wants to deposit surplus cash with the central bank, it won't earn any interest. In fact, the bank will actually have to pay the ECB for the privilege of parking its cash.\n\nThat seems to turn the whole lending process on its head. Traditionally, when you deposit money, you earn interest, which seems to rank up there with the sun rises in the east rule.\n\nBy moving to negative interest rates on deposits, the ECB is pushing banks to stop hoarding surplus cash. It wants banks to lend that money to businesses to fund plant expansions, or to consumers for a new cars or homes.\n\nIn other words, the ECB is insisting that banks get money circulating in the real economy, not piling up in vaults.\n\nGermany's Economy Is Doing Well — And That's Bad For The Eurozone\n\nBut there's another reason for this negative rate strategy. The ECB wants to push down euro zone interest rates in general to make it a less attractive place for global investors to put their cash.\n\nAs those investors move their money over to the United States in search of higher interest rate returns, the euro will get weaker and the dollar stronger. In fact, that's exactly what happened after the ECB announcement: the value of the euro slid against the dollar, down to a four month low of about $1.35. That is well below the 2 1/2 year high of about $1.40.\n\nAnd that was exactly the point. The ECB's action was intended \"to be a signal that the euro's value has been way too high,\" said Alexander Privitera, director of the economics program at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies.\n\nWhile a weaker euro could make life a bit tougher for United States  exporters in the short term, it could help revive the European economy — and that ultimately would create a healthier European market for United States  goods and services.\n\nRobert Kahn, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , was more skeptical about the likelihood of reviving the European economy. \"These moves will be largely ineffective,\" he said.\n\nKahn says the ECB needs to take much more aggressive actions, similar to those taken by the United States  Federal Reserve. That would involve massive asset purchases to create more liquidity in financial markets, he said.\n\nBut most economists cheered the ECB action.\n\n\"This is a long overdue step and signals that the ECB may finally be taking seriously the dangerous consequences of deflation,\" Cornell University economics professor Steven Kyle said in a statement. \"It certainly shows a clear break with past attitudes and should be applauded.\"\n\nSo, to answer those two questions originally posed:\n\n1) Pushing interest rates to less than zero is a little crazy, but for Europe, it just might work.\n\n2) A lot of United States  businesses care about what happens in Europe because it is a huge market for United States  exports. And in a world where financial markets are closely linked, Americans don't want to see a deflationary cycle take hold in Europe and start pulling down financial markets again.\n\nEconomy\n\nYou must be signed in to leave a comment.

Nearly half of those men live in poverty.\n\n\"The largest share of stay at home dads are actually home because they're ill or disabled,\" says Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher at Pew. \"So that could be contributing to their low income, obviously.\"\n\nAnother chunk of men say they're at home because they can't find a job.\n\n\"About 22 percent don't have a high school diploma,\" says Livingston, \"and 36 percent have just a high school diploma but no college experience.\"\n\nStill, the fastest growing group among stay at home fathers is men who say they are home specifically to provide child care. Five percent said that in 1989, and 21 percent say it today.\n\nJust half of stay at home fathers are white, and black dads are twice as likely as white men to be home with their children.\n\nMark Portis, who lives near St. Louis, is African American and dropped out of high school in his junior year (he later got his GED). He has two young children with his wife, but he also has three older daughters he never lived with, he says. He never married their mothers.\n\nWhen he finally did marry, he says he wanted things to be different.\n\n\"I've been a stay at home dad for ... six years,\" he says at his home in St. Louis. His 6 year old son is at camp, and his 3 year old daughter is being fussy about lunch. \"She wants candy,\" he laughs.\n\nPortis used to be a manager in auto parts shops, but his wife earned a lot more as an accountant. When they decided someone should stay home with the children, he says it made sense that it was him.\n\n\"I love it,\" he says. \"It's fun. I can be 110 percent involved in the kids and what they have going on.\"\n\nPortis says his support group of full time dads is almost all white. But it doesn't surprise him that many stay at home dads are black, like himself.\n\n\"[For] a lot of African Americans, that's how they were raised,\" he says. \"Everybody has to work, everybody has to contribute. If you can't afford child care, one works nights, one works days and you're just kind of passing the kids back and forth.\"\n\n\"We have a longstanding tradition in African American families of fathers doing a lot with their kids,\" says Scott Coltrane, the provost at the University of Oregon, who has studied fathers for three decades. Coltrane says black dads who live with their kids have always helped out more at home. And in today's labor market, they're also more likely to be out of a job.\n\n\"What's different is culturally now, most parents do a little bit of both,\" he says. \"We expect women to work. We expect men to do more at home.\"\n\nThat, he says, is the biggest shift in the last few decades, and it's true for everyone, regardless of race.\n\nTwo million stay at home dads is a much bigger number than the Census Bureau's number of 214,000.
