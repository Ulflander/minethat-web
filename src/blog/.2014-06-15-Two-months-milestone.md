# Minethat: it's been two months

Two months ago, I started working on Minethat.

Here is what I achieved,
what I learnt, and the next milestones for the project.

## Achievements

### A first partner

I can announce officialy that Minethat is partnering
with [News On Demand](newsondemand.co), a mobile application that offers news
based on readers attention span.

NOD is made by [@M_C_B](https://twitter.com/M_C_B), who is a 2014 Knight fellow.

### A first prototype

I got a first prototype of the app.
