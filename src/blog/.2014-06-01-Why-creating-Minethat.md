It's always good to know why we're really doing something. Most of the time it may be 
just about money, or about passion, or about people. But it's important to know what

### Our future is endangered

A lot of us will be alive in a few dozens of years to witness some turmoils 
never seen in Humanity history. It may sound catastrophic, but this is what we should be prepared to.

Our bias is to promote the best information, not the bullshit you can read all over the Internet. Our bias is to promote the best quality of writing, not the short overviews written like on an assembly line.

In fact we're the first curation platform that is engaged for the future. Because providing to people more qualitative content allows them to better understand the world, and therefore being able to act on it more responsibly.

### At the end of the day

Our goal is to promote intelligence,
